Kids love peanut butter sandwiches.

Mm-hmm. The girls will hold your hand if you have peanut butter and jam.

You know, when you sit with your friends, you play video games and you have fun. And if you eat such a sweet sandwich before you do that, then it's really cool.










And the kids will always be able to get these sweet buns.



















































So my cousin's big brother's best friend's sister's sister's gonna bring them in this afternoon. I know how stupid that sounds, but I'm afraid to take them myself.
