You're gonna meet your big brother's best friend's sister again.


































































Johnny says he fucking refuses. - Tell him he's my best employee. And ask me what the hell it is.
Hey, Johnny. Frankie said you were one of his best employees, and what's the problem?






































I thought that would never happen to me. That my best friend would betray me.




































































Look, I got a free catcher, cracked Nick's team and forced Nick to turn his back on one of his best friends.



I think I got a good return on the investment. Isn't it?






















You set up your best friend.



I don't think that's a good idea.














































































But good players usually only come out of nerds.

And what if it doesn't just go through this, but everything else gets much better.

































































What's going on with you all? Derek knows better than Scott how bad things are.
So it's up to him to remove the threat quickly, even if it means someone's gonna get hurt, and it's better than letting something get out of control where you can't contain it anymore.
























It's okay, okay? If there's anything you can do to help, do it.

Dear shoes suggest good income, strong drinks in the middle of the day mean that you're looking for any way to forget and, like me, treat heartache with something even stronger than my cocktail.

She'll be back, master. Maybe any minute now, if not now, he'll be back in the morning.
In the morning?
























That's better.


























































That's better.







































Yeah, yeah, okay.


























































March 8, 1912, you already had a meeting at 10:23 a.m.























































































There's another fruit left from the Oun's family tree, and this fruit isn't very good.




- All the better.
Very good, Mr. Hemingway.




































- Forget about them, it's okay when we're sitting like this.
















































And I have some good news for you and Mathilde.

Oh, that's good news, Ezra.

It's better not to even walk by them.

























- Okay, stay like this.











- Okay.





It's better than walking to New York.













It's a good thing.































- Come on, you better go to bed.












- You too, miss, have a good evening.




























- Okay, then I'm here.



























- If you don't need money, then it's just a good show.









































- Okay.












Okay.











































Okay?























































































































- Okay.




That's good.




















Mr. Todd, you're the best person in the world.



































































It's a great music show with the best songs you've ever heard.



























- Okay.































































































































Ezra, you should probably go back to bed.













Okay, Pete, how about 20 "shoes"?



















- Okay.

















































Oh, I know a good place where we can eat with good health.








































Let him work until we find someone better.









































































































The more mysterious, the better publicity.













































































































Okay, everybody on stage.






























I don't feel so good either.







































































Okay, do you love me?



If I invest in this show, I want to make sure we have the best music ever.

Good songs attract people to the theater.

I'm not gonna put in a cent until we find a better dramatist...


That's right. We need good, energetic music.
You need a good actor in the lead.













































How can a show be good without you, beautiful girls?





















I knew it was best to stay home.

















































































































































































I'd better be alone if you don't mind.





























































































































Okay. Good night.



























Perhaps you should sit down.













It's better now.
I'm sure we'll be good friends soon enough.























Yeah, oh, well, of course in that case, I, uh...














































































Yeah, he's coming, it's okay.
































































































Good morning!
Good morning, Your Highness.













You know, today's gonna be a good day.









Okay.

Put all your best on, darling!













Good morning!
Good morning, my dear.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning!
















Good morning, good morning!







You know, for years, I haven't felt as good as this morning for food and everything.












Very good.







Good morning, good morning!
Good morning!

Good morning!







And how do you feel this lovely morning?
Very good, thank you.
























Good morning, good morning.

Good morning.





































































Okay, but because of that...








































I'm good at that. Ha!





































































































































































Okay, Mom.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































Good news?
























- "Accorded." It's better to say it's bad speculation.










It'd be too good to make it easy.

































































Have a nice day.

















































- It's good wine.


















On the Rural Far Piaz, a good ship.


























































































































































- Are your pills better?















































And you're my best friend...



























































































- Okay, I'll keep quiet.










- I see a good time for you.































































- I'm fine.












































































































































































































































































































- Okay.







































- Anyway, this baby's gonna be fine here.












- Okay.
























































































































- That's not a good thing to say about the past.































































- Okay.






























































- Okay.










































































































































































- Pierre, this is too good and unexpected.

- I find it very good.























































































































































































- She was good.












Okay.







































Better not be a fool.











































- He's one of the best pilots in this country.






















































..you fired the best newspaper you've ever had in your dirty, embarrassing newspaper.
























































What you need is a good nose puff.













































































































Good morning.


















































































































I don't think there's anything better than meeting a mom from a high circle who can stand up for herself.


























































I don't think we can cross the river till morning.






Okay, thanks.













































































I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.





























You better get your stuff off Jericho's wall.













You'll change your mind tomorrow morning.

















































All the best houses have these things outside.

















































What made you so very friendly this morning?











That's gonna make a good story for the article.




















































































































You know, you were good. I just dived into the role.






























































































































































































































He was a good guy, just like you, but one day he made a big mistake.



































When we get to the next town, you better get in touch with your dad.
































I bet your family doesn't have any good riders.


Show me a good catalyst, and I'll show you a real man.


















































































































































































































































































We're gonna have to figure something out before morning.















Tomorrow morning, you'll be in the arms of your husband.






























































Let's do this. When I get back in the morning, I'll buy it back.
























Every time I bumped into a good story, I used it on you, didn't I?






















































We wouldn't have known until morning if I hadn't gone up for magnesia.



































I think he's still the best journalist on this case.
































































































































































































































































































































































































































It's a good thing I'm leaving.











































- Well, if you think everything's gonna be okay...








































Then you better get home before it gets ruined.
Okay.


































































Better do it now before I forget it.




































































Okay, I'll give it to you.




















































































- I invited him this morning.













































- Much better, yours?























































Very good.









































































- Chris! - Okay. Okay.

- I said good.














































- Okay, girls.

































































































- Okay, then I'll do it.




















It's good old days.




- Is he good?






























- Was he a good detective?

















Good job for you, Nick.



































































































































































































































I'll tell you some detective stories in the morning.






















All right, come on in.



















All right, shoot.
















Stadsy Burke said you were a good guy, so I'm here.





























- Okay.



























We thought we'd be better off around here in case the old man showed up.









































We'll come to you tomorrow when you're better.












But, honey, it's the best gift I've ever had for Christmas.









































- Good morning.


- Okay.









I got a letter from Winant this morning.













It's not good if he's out at a time like this.






Okay.





























- Good morning.
- Good morning.

Not a very good trick on your part to leave the house while you have to rest before I question you.



















































































It's better if you tell me everything first.




























































Okay.




































Okay, I'll tell them who did it.















































































































It's okay, Asta.



































Okay.

































































































































































































It's a good place to get in trouble.
















































































































































































































Yeah, that's the best thing I've ever heard of.































Okay.























































Telegrams and calls were good, but nobody actually saw Vinant alive.











You got a good price for saying you saw Winant.































































































Kihachi was so good when he was young.








Think of Goemon Isikigawa.












































































You're gonna be a good chess player.























My son belongs to a better world than yours.




























Better get us lucky, like in fairy tales.

























































Okay.







Which could be better.









































































































Ah, the lovely little one is the best gift ever!




































































































No, you better, I'll tell you later.















- Oh, it's so good to be home.






With a good salary...













































































































































































































































- Okay. Bravo!































































































































Okay... well, don't worry...

































Now turn left... okay. Now this way...



































The caviar will be in the morning and in the evening...


















If you need soap, count on me! The train leaves in 23 minutes. - Okay...










































































































If it's in the morning, it's 2,000 francs a month. Not bad in modern times.
































































- Are you happy? Did it go well?
































































































































The next morning, a little chimney-cleaner and his master are on their way to work.
























































Our benevolence will be an oath to stay with you... in good and bad times... whatever it takes!










































You can take power with power... but it's much better to win with the heart of the nation.

















































































































































































































And since these are the best racial qualities of the German nation... they can, in proud self-respect... have the right to lead the Reich and the people.


Anyone who feels like he's the bearer of the best blood... and consciously uses it to gain power... will never back down from this course!








But only the best National Socialists are Party Comrades!












































































































































































































- I'll rest until morning.




If everything's gonna be okay, I'm gonna visit someone there.












Good morning.

















What a joke at five o'clock in the morning.










































































"At 7:00 a.m., the cleaning lady, Elizabeth Briggs..."

















- I can tell you better.






































































He'll stay till morning.





















- Why? He says it's best not to know about such depraved places.
























You'd better go.










































That's better.



















- Hello. Did you see any strangers this morning?






















































Anyway, I'm in court every morning.























































































He's my best friend.



















































I call upon your candidate and all those who are dear to their loved ones to make it possible for us to live in a better world, where there is no inter-ethnic strife and no strife between neighbours, where no one is persecuted, where all things are honored... and people help each other.















































































































































- Okay, sir.
































































Okay.









I'm not happy with the prospect of waking up in the morning to see... your monster face in front of me.

































































Okay, ma'am. Right.


























Good morning.






































































































- It's okay.
































































What if it's better?





















































































Okay!




















































It's good to have a mom, too.





















It's good to move on.
He's a good man, isn't he?










It's good to move on.
































































































































































He's been wearing my good shoes ever since.











































































































- Good morning.
- Good morning.

- Okay, but not for long.




































In dealing with girls and horses, it's better to let events go their own way.











































































































Okay.





I'm her best defense!







































Okay.


























































- Much better, thank you, Bates.
































































- Okay.


I still have some good news.
























We're going to Italy in the morning.


















































































Despite the fact that all men are males, nothing compares to a sense of security with a good, faithful husband. I know.











- Okay.




























































































































































Okay, well, find out all about her past, and I'm gonna go plan her future.

- Okay, I promise.





You know, sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I look at him and I feel scared too.



























































































All right, sir.





Please send a good juicy steak.


































I'm rich, I'm good, and then this Hardwick guy's gonna leave you alone.
























You better take off your glasses!































- Okay.
- Okay? What do we do now?





























































Okay.






















Well, if you're calming down, maybe it's for the best if you don't kill him.

























Boys, if Dale and Jerry are sailing at sea, maybe it's better to help them.













































- Okay, sir.
- Okay?
















































































Oh, yeah, okay, very good!
















I have news for you, good news, wonderful news.













































































It's not good to be so annoying.












































































































































































You have something better and more charming.

















































































































































































































































































Okay.






























- Okay.











































































































































































It's gonna be okay.



- Well, if he doesn't show up by tomorrow morning, I'll go to the police and see what I can do.

























































Okay, Henry.



No, you'd better go.


Okay, I'm gonna go.











































































































- Well, that's better.















































It was good.







































Okay.










- This morning.


You've got a nice table here, you know.


















- Okay, Dancer, if you insist.































































- Okay, I'll pay you.


















You know, it's still better than watching him sit here drunk.


- Okay.
































- Or don't? - Okay.








































































- You look too beautiful in the morning.

Drink, fight, look scary in the morning.











You know, I don't like to make remarks, Dancer, but, you know, it doesn't work out very well when you and your partner and your primadonna and your best client are all getting out of here at the same time.


























- You better go.


























































































But you better lie down and rest.


















Hurry! - Okay, I'll tell you.















































I thought I'd get out of there if I didn't want to get in trouble.












































































































































Okay.






















































- All right, let her out.








- Did you and Landis have a good relationship?





















- I should probably get out.
























It's okay, David.












































Of course I don't cook as well as you do.








I'll have pictures of me in the morning.











No, it's better that way.


































































Good doggy.





















Good morning, Peters.

- Good morning, Peters.







- Good day?










If you didn't wake me up, you could sleep till morning.








- Good morning.


































- $75, that's better.















Hey, good doggy.











Okay.






















































































































Okay.






































































































- Okay.














































































































































































Okay, darling.




























































































































This morning.






















































































Best detective ever!





































Okay.
















































When I left home, I had the best dowry in town.











































- Good idea!


- Okay.






























































- Good morning, Omota.

- Omota, I have good news for you.




He visited me this morning.






























He came in this morning and asked us to stay.



















- Very good.































Do you have any good?







I don't think you can afford it. The best choice for you is Viscose kimono.
So you'd better pick up somewhere else.

































It's the best I've got for today.

































































































- Good idea.




Driver, please return to Simoquia Street. - Okay.










































- That would be good, but Mr. Furusawa is your sister's patron.













- Bring us something to eat, the best.


































- That's good with sake.






































































- Good morning.






- Okay, I'll take it.







































































- Okay.














































































- It's too good to be true.


































































































- What good is there?















Very good.


























































- Okay.



























































































































- Is she gonna be okay?



















Be a good girl.















































Okay.



















Okay.


Okay, okay!












This morning, I've already heard the spicy.








































Jackson wired this morning.






You said nothing would stop you... but you better put on your pants.






























































I'll take you on the best trip I can... as soon as we're done here.



































































Nothing serious, but I thought I'd better call you...










































But we need something on her... and I'm gonna turn to the best man we've ever had. Who's that?




And you fired him. The best man in defamation suits.










All right, get Haggerty on the line.

















Okay, but hurry up.
























Of course he's a good friend of mine.



























Good morning.













Have you found a good man for dirty business?




Have a nice day.










Goodbye. - Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning, sir.


Very good, sir.











Okay, we'll talk.































Have you read any good books recently?





















































































Isn't that right, Bill? - Yeah, if they know you as well as I do.
























You're a good friend.


- Okay.

























































































It's a good thing I haven't unpacked them yet.























Okay.
































Yeah, Daddy, it's okay.































The best rainbow trout is in the lake...


The best rainbow trout is in Lake Taupo in New Zealand.

The best rainbow trout is in Lake Taupo in New Zealand.
The best rainbow trout is in Lake Taupo in New Zealand.



We're very grateful for what you did this morning.
















- Okay.
Now, young man, my daughter and I wanted to thank you for everything you've done this morning.


























I apologize for being rude this morning.





















































































































































Okay.

































Okay, then I'll wait in my quarters at 7:00.







- Okay.


























It's infinitely better than most people you can meet on a ship.




- At least she's from a good family.














































No, I'd better stay away.

















- I'll bring you an instructor in the morning.
- In the morning?





















Bill, I'll send you an instructor first thing tomorrow morning.


It's gonna be okay, honey.













Good morning.

































Okay, let's talk.




- Good morning.






Good morning, Mr. Evans.















































A breath of air at dawn is the best cure in the world.































He's good.

































































































Almost as good as dancing.




























































































- Okay.













































- She left this morning. - That's right.










































If he starts this tomorrow morning, we'll be in jail by tonight.




















For such a good, sensitive girl.




- Okay.




























































But I drive with you every morning.








































All they need now is another good scandal.



























She was afraid he was hurt by something she told him this morning.












Okay.

















Okay, try it.



























































































































Okay.





































Okay, I'll meet you.




















































Trust me, it's better and better.















Maybe it's better this way.





After all, I want you to be good friends.













































I just came by to give you some good news.




- Okay.




























































































- Okay, sir.
















It's even better for me.

It's much better here.





We had so much fun together, so much fun.

























































I think it's best if you wait here.




- Okay.


- Okay.




















































































































Call me in the morning.



























































































You made a good mess. And all because of trying to steal Gladys!

























































































Even when I'm acting like a good wife, my husband doesn't pay any attention to me.
When did you act like a good wife? If it comes to that, I think it's over.


















- Good morning.









































































































I hope he can find a good job.


It's better not to have a father at all.












Good morning.




































What a good day it is.



































The reason I'm in good shape is in constant burning.




















































































































































What I want now is to marry a good man.
That would be best.































That's good.














































































































Be a good boy.















































The best thing about your situation is to repent and tell me everything. Excuse me.












































































































































































I didn't make a good impression on him either.



















































What good does that do you?









































With good references, a month later, I became a doorman at La Rue's restaurant in Madeleine Square.




















But at 4:00 a.m., someone knocked on my door.



By 7:00 A.M., it was all decided the roles were distributed.


































































- It's me. - Okay, madam.



























































There was a kind of music cafe with a bad reputation where we were going to have fun in the evenings.


































A family of five who thought they were the best in the world.






















































I've decided to have a good breakfast in the best inn in town.













But there was a mystery in her eyes this morning.























"Okay, thank you. Put it there and leave us."





















"Okay, madam. Okay, madam."







"Ma'am, that's a good price." "For 300,000, I'll take it."



















































"Okay, madam."





















































"A third cylinder. Okay."





















Throwing out zero is good, but five times in a row, it's very serious!















This is the best exercise ever.















"Pas." "Okay."



















Okay!






































"Very good."
























He's got nine, too. That's so good!

I repeated "no" so quickly that everyone looked at me and Charbonier leaned over to get a better look at me.
































It's not even better... even worse!




































- Okay!
- How good?




























































Well, Jeeves, it's all good on paper, but I...






































I'm afraid I'll have to leave you early in the morning.




- Very good, sir.













































That's good.









- All right, take her stuff. - What am I supposed to do with them?
































- All right, connect, and I'll listen.














- Good morning, Jeeves.
- Good morning, sir.






































- Oh, good.



- Is today gonna be a good day, Jeeves?









And as adults, take it out on the moon! - That's it, that's good!




Okay! Okay!































- Sit back, okay?














- And not well, sir.













We'd better roll!




























































Okay, thanks. You search him first.















































And this morning, Wooster and his servant got out of the house, got in the car and left!






I'm afraid he's gonna have to wait for her there for a very long time, because I met this girl here in this hotel this morning.





































- Very good, sir. Take Mr. Wooster to his room.


Okay.










































































































I think you'd better go. I'm sick of all this nonsense.





















Okay. No, I can't leave until I do what I came for!





Okay, I'll tell you everything.

























I don't understand why you don't want to change your miserable life for the better!





The government will have them tomorrow morning.













































I understand your concern, gentlemen, and I assure you, everything will be settled tomorrow morning!










I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay. I'm guessing tomorrow you're gonna be writing reports on this case, and you can point out that Bertie Wooster... sorted it out.

































Yeah, well, I'll just help the lady sit down. Please, have a seat.







Okay, I'm gonna sit in that chair across the street.














As you can see, your plan failed. Marjorie, I think you'd better come clean.


Well, that's very good.











Are you feeling better?



































Very good, sir.



















































































- Good morning, Patrick.


















Guilty, and the first morning.









































































































Good morning, Mr. Stanhop.


Good morning, Mr. Stanhop.

Good morning, Mr....






Good morning, V.S. Damn, it's good to see you.


- Good morning, Miss Spence.
- Good morning.
Good morning.

- Oh, good morning, Mr. Stanhop.
- Good morning, Mary.
That's good.


Maybe I haven't seen him in a while, but he's gotta look better than that.





















They didn't finish until this morning.









From the traditional meeting, from morning to evening.


- Good idea, huh?




















- Okay, thank you, V.S.
- Okay.







- Okay.




















Well, we're not gonna find anything better than Bucknell, V.S.
The portrait itself is good, but it's not good enough for our story.





























We've been advertising Pandor's cream for nine years, and we've always made good profits from it.







Okay, I'll think about it.













The national weekly is now a tasty piece, and with our editing and promotional campaign, we're gonna make it the best five-cent weekly in the country.

















































Look, okay?





























I bet he knows our moves better than we do.


Okay, then I'll recommend something now.







































































No, it's okay, V.S.

Okay.


If you think it's a good job, I don't think so.



















































































- That's better.



























I'm the best, aren't I?
Best.


I've worked for a lot of people, but he's definitely the best.



And he's got the best wife.
























































































But you have a good job, and you're getting more attached to it, and you're going to parties like tonight, dating people like Stanhops.











We'll do what's best for us.





















































By the way, if you're counting on a lot of circulation, I have a better idea.











- You have to admit, that's a good idea.











- How did you get dressed this morning?


- Okay.
- She's too good for you.




























- But we're better.
































































































- Okay.






















































- Okay.


































































- Okay.












Okay.

























Oh, you caught a cold, V.S. And on such a beautiful morning, it must be driving me crazy.




- Okay.











And for the final report, it's better to hire a private accountant from the outside,







































Yeah, you better stay there for a few weeks.
That's what's best.









V.S. I think it's best if you go on your own.


























"Are you good enough for her?"





"Well, since there's no one better than me, hold her tight."

























































Okay, connect.














- Okay, you guys.






- Okay.













































- Okay.
You'd better get some rest.









You'd better go to my room.
Okay.
- Good night and good morning.





- Tomorrow morning.




















































That's a good idea.
You better get out of here.
































Good morning, sir.




Good morning, Ellen.





Okay, tell Mrs. Stanhop I'm back and I want to see her.

- Good morning.


































































































































We've been kicked out of better places.
And where the whiskey was better.










































You'd better go.






















I thought I'd better send the letters today.






























- Well, there are good ones.





































Look at the steam pipe.








































































I'll be better... he likes me.















Your ship arrived early. Unfortunately, we won't be here until tomorrow morning. Your foster father and Mitsuko.

My foster father is coming tomorrow morning.








































Well, okay.

























































































Not very well.












And it's a good thing you inhaled some of that Western spirit. This spirit is essential if our old Japan is to survive in the struggle for a living space.














Yeah, it's okay, Father.
Good thing you're here!






It's a good thing you came home.


It's a good land, but it's old.



























Well, are you okay?















Okay.




























Okay, I will.
It's better if we don't meet him.













































It doesn't matter what he says. She's gonna be a good wife to him, and everything's gonna be okay.











































She was a good friend to you.
And you... will be a good wife to me.



























































Good dog! Mommy's gone, huh?



































































































I appreciate your generosity, but you'd better leave.















Do you really want to leave?


- Maybe it's the best solution.









Of course he's better with humor than I am!








Nope. You knew the letter could wait till morning, but Armand Duval...









You think the best defense is assault?








































































































































































































































"Give me a house where cow herds... "Good morning, Ma.

You came back in the morning.
































I hope he's the best man I've ever met.










Didn't hear the best joke of the year: "Isn't that the woman I saw you with?"

You know, this is the best place in town.

























































New York is good for the other side, I wouldn't want to live here.




































All right, sir.






















































You've been celebrated from the best side.














- Let's get back to business, okay?






























How can you know the feelings of someone who took her best years?







































...I'm definitely getting better.
















Take a better look at him, it'll do you good.
















It's just that we've never kissed before, and this isn't the best place.






































































- And it would be better if Mr. Leeson wasn't found.







































































































- Okay.







Yeah, that's much better.


















Lucy, you didn't come by this morning, as usual.






















Well, the man's best friend is his mother.






































































It was a good time.






































Okay, honey, I'm gonna make sure you guys get to know each other.

- And my best...






























































































- Okay.




















- My father sent the best garden architect to Princeton.



- That's right. He's good to me.

































Have a good day!




























































































Will you deliver my car in the morning?




















- Okay.













































































- Sorry, sir. - Nothing, darling. Nothing good!
Good morning, sir.

































































































































































I can afford the best.

































































Good morning.






































Yeah, okay.









He's a good guy. He's a quick learner.












































































































































- No, he can't. Why? He's a good guy.









Guys, why don't we take him with us? He's a good guy.





















I wish you were dead.


























Yes. And very good.






It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
























I know this house so well, like I built it myself.
























































































































- I'm not good enough for you? - No, come on.












































































I've always taught him only good things.



Enemy... what good do they see in life?






Yeah, you always said you'd take down all those slums someday and build good houses where happy people would live.













































That's not very good.





Okay. Give me a couple hours.







































































I'll do the autopsy in the morning.

























































































































































It's a good thing we figured that out now.





























































































He gave up because he thought it would be better.








I'll get him out of here. He's a good guy, and he's smart.










He'll be better off where he's going.
























We're gonna get Tommy out. We'll find him the best lawyer in the morning.


















Okay, Doctor.




















































Okay.















































You'd better not work tomorrow. I'm gonna fix the bandage.











I feel good now.













It's better this way.




























































And if you succeed in making something new... and the best, you can count on my protection.























































































































































Better get him to the hospital.













Okay, that's your choice.












You better get out of here now.





















Okay.


It's the best, doc, 14 years old.





































You're a good assistant.









Well, is it better now?


They couldn't choose the best doctor to weaken.












I mean, something good that I like.

Okay, remember, I'll see you at the clinic tomorrow.

















I was at your place this morning.
Good morning, Mrs Mooney.










































































































































Then, Grot, my good man, let it be a lesson for you.
















































































































Okay, the patient has to come back.
























Okay.



















































Okay, come on.







































Two bucks a visit is very good.










Okay.





































Okay.









































I did a little investigation this morning.




























I have a good place in mind. Maybe you'd agree.



Yours isn't very good.





























My money isn't good enough for you, is it?








- That's good.























Well, yeah, okay, but...
























































































































Okay.


































































Okay.















































































































































































































I got a little cold, but it's okay.







Let Pa tell you.

Oh, they're good.























































Yeah, I'm fine.































































































That's better.






It's good to live with your kids.
































Okay.



























































Okay.

- You think he's okay?
- Of course it's good.

























































By the way, good hand from worms.
































- That's a good show, isn't it?


















- It was good.




A good young man, I mean.




















Oh, I'm good.






















And don't worry, okay?




You could buy yourself a nice warm scarf for that money.
Okay, Bark.





























She's a good girl.





In general, I have good kids, I'm proud of them.










































But what, everybody has to do what they think is best.
































Perhaps you should wait until your glasses are fixed.































































































































































It would be nice if your mother were here.












- Good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning, Mr. Payne. Who's sick?
























































Okay.


































Wouldn't it be better to send him to California?
I think it would be a good idea to send him anywhere.

I always think my dad can't handle these terrible winters, and California would be better.















- He's good, isn't he?








































It's gonna be okay.















































































Never thought a nursing home was a good place.










































I think I've made a mistake somewhere, even though I've always tried to be a good wife and mother.





























































































- Oh, good.















Oh, well, I'm better now.
























































































































- Did it go well?



- Yeah, we thought it'd be good.








- Are you okay, Lucy?





















I guess I seemed better for her, so she chose me.




























































That's not very good, George.















































































































- I just thought, if you check... or later, at the border, having tickets is always good.

























































Otherwise, it's only in the morning, by breakfast.













































































































- Yes. It's always the best.























































You will treat the Dams with the utmost attention... and personally help them with their landing tomorrow morning. It's done.







In the morning after we arrive, we'll take care of the girls, as usual?


























Oh, please pay the driver, okay?





































































The real social man with the money... is the one who orders most of the best hotels with meatballs, double.

























Okay.



- In that case, it's good!



























































































































- All right.











































It would be best if we were to be quiet and modest, kind and friendly to people.


























































This morning at 10:30 this young man entered the World Exposition... from the rest park by pulling out the fence. He didn't have an entry ticket.















































































































- Okay!








Two of my acquaintances were supposed to come with the north express this morning.



















































































































































Sleep well, my ladies!











































All right.

















































































































































































Okay.




- It's better than the originals from the state's typography.























But Mary Berry and Jane Berry would be better off staying in Middletown.


























































































But I'd rather not say anything about it.










































































At the age of 20, he won a competition for the best sketches of new 50-franco banknotes.





Even better than the originals.

















I wish I'd told you something nice. Then you could believe me.








Tomorrow morning they wouldn't be serving oatmeal soup, but a real breakfast. Nine o'clock.























































- Then that's good, Mr. Police Counselor!

















Everybody's gone! - Okay.






- We couldn't have wanted a better identity.









'Cause I'm going as a good friend. Hmm?

















Good idea.
- Not as good as I thought.

























































































































































































































































































































































We wanted to do what's best.

























Good morning.



Good morning!








For the first time in three days, good weather, and you're a suicide.







Sorry, it's such a good day.



































































I've been singing this Golden Fish all morning.























It's better this way.














































You're a good man, you bought us five bottles for the party.























Good morning.







































Yeah, okay.


Good morning.


































Okay, thank you...










































































































































I'll bring you some good news tomorrow, don't worry.




































And my best wishes.





















































































































No, I gave everything this morning for a shipment of alcohol.

















That's good.







































































Okay... stay with her for a few days.




































































Mr. Mori, I'll be at your house at 8:00 a.m.
Okay?
Eight o'clock in the morning.




Give him my best wishes, sir.
Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock.


































































Here, with your best wishes.

Good morning!
It's a good day, isn't it?

























































You're a good man.






















































































Okay, I'll give it back.





















It's gonna be okay.


























































Why not? Better than knocking on wheels.







That's better.












- The further, the better.













































































































The next morning, his body was found on the way.

6:00 in the morning!

Okay.


















Good morning, gentlemen!

Good morning.

Good morning. Tickets.
Good morning, sir.

Ah, good morning, sir.










- Don't put it on the shelf, okay?























































































Look, we better not argue with him.










































Did they leave this morning or not?



























I don't know what he's doing, but he's the one who left this morning with the band on the train.













Yeah, and this morning, he took my train. And I need an explanation.












































































I've been pulled out of the stations better than this one!







































































































- All right, I...













































































He can't take our weight. Better...













































































All right.



































































































































































































































































Working with people, I respect and appreciate a good job.






























































- Tell them to stop. - Okay.

























Slow gets better results.
















































































































He's a bad man, but a good son.
And we're not gonna arrest a good son, we're gonna arrest a bad man.





























Ines in the morning, Ines in the afternoon, Inez in the evening. You're not a woman..... but a diet.

The best thing about traveling is going home.
And I was happy here and a little sad to be back.





































































































































































































































































































































































































































































It must be in vain to pretend you're particularly good.







































































































































































































































I'm sorry to find that you're not better.
















































































They're going to see Miss Livvy, so she better go home immediately.

Good morning, Susan.





















Good morning, ladies.














Good morning, Patty.



























Good morning, Patty.










































Actually, I think you all should go.

Miss Livvy is much better, sir, and she agreed to come out to see you.





















































































































































































































It's gonna be okay! But I need somewhere to sleep at night.
















































































































































































































































































































































































































































Okay!

In all the woods, you won't find a hunter better than me.






Good food, good company, beautiful lady society that flatters us, huh, Lady Marianne?

He's the best archer in England, and my brave county sheriff is afraid of him!










With the best wishes of your brother, King Richard, may God bless him!































Such recklessness must have a good appetite.

And he can provide shelter and food to a group of good, determined men, good archers, swordsmen and fighters.



















































































I'm fine here.





















Come with me, and I promise you the best deer pie, and the biggest one, you've never eaten that!

You better go before I change my mind.
We'd better go.









































He's the best shooter in the North.
And he's gonna want to be the best in England.

Okay, you can fight me all you want, just wait till morning.








































Or better at the window?













Personally, at 5:00 a.m., I was fishing in Seine.

- Okay, monsieur.













































We're gonna win, even better.
























If so, you'd better go back to your table.






























I wish this meeting hadn't happened.






















Good joke?








































































- Okay.










Yeah... yeah... and then he was in a good mood all day.


















































































































































But the headache for the morning is worth the toast.



















































































Much better.





Good story?






I feel so good!

Okay.
















Okay.



I could have picked up a hundred different epithets... but it would be better to say it directly.




















































































- No, but... I have a better idea.








































































Then what do they wear in the morning?











Nino, I wouldn't ask if we weren't good friends...

















As they say, the guests are good, but the houses are better.































































































- Good morning, comrade.

I wish there was a good catch.















































- Have a good sleep.

Have a good sleep.



































































































































































His Lordship is a better shooter.

God, it's too good to be true!


















There's no place better than home.








Better at home...
































And Aunt Em, there's no place better than home!

























The best is always the last. Don't you think?

It's gonna be okay.





















It's better this way.

Okay, I'm gonna go.


















All right.








This is where our best horses are buried.



- That was my father's best horse.





























I'll be waiting for you. Have a nice day.
























































That's my father's best horse.

























Casiano, if my father finds out what you're doing to his best horse, he'll stick your ears to the stable door.








































































He jumps with your dad in the morning, and he runs with you in the afternoon.
He couldn't jump over the bar this morning.

















He's gonna be okay.












A very good horse.











Okay.
















































The best thing we can do for him is not to interfere.
























- We've been trying to reach you all morning.





























































































And this horse is even better.

































































































































At first, I wanted Furioso off the race, but this guy said he was a good jockey.



Maybe this guy is a really good jockey.




















































































































And I think it's for the best.








































































It's okay.































































































Okay.





























































I've got a better story.



























It's better now.









I'm waiting for the morning when I come to wake up, and I'm gonna have to pull the blanket, not pull it back.







You get to the window at 6:00 a.m., you open up, you get in, and you get in bed.




Get up at 6:00 A.M., climb the windows...

















Here's a good reason:







































































































































































































































































































































































That's too good, isn't it?






















That's good.
























It's a good thing he's in the suitcase.























































Why don't you sit down?


Yeah, that's better.

































Okay. Miss Carter saved my life.

















































I'd give you a lot for a good joke right now.































Okay.



















































































Feed once a day, walk for a few minutes in the morning and in the evening.









Lock the door and don't open until morning.







































Good morning, Miss Carter.
Good morning.





























































































Yeah, before I forget, the Santana Hotel is good?

Best food at Las Palmas in Malecon.





















I'm sorry, but my doctor warned me this morning of a nervous shock.






































Okay.


































































































































It's better than a knife.


























































































































































































































































But there aren't many bastards that make a good man stick on a car.

















































































Some people do good things, others don't. And that's all we can say.






















































































































































































































































There's no choice, Tommy. But it's gonna be okay.




























- Hello, Tommy, it's okay.
































































































































































It's gonna be okay, Grandpa.




It's okay, Grandpa.

















I don't know if he was a good person or a bad person, but it doesn't matter.


But I won't pray for the old man. He's dead, and he's okay.






















Maybe when we get to the place, we'll find a job. Or maybe a piece of good land by the water, it's not gonna be that bad.





No, we don't have any money. But there's a lot of us, all working good people.
Good money, hard work, and everything's gonna be okay.
Is it good to make money? At a collection of oranges and peaches?




Now I'm going back to starving. It's better to starve to death.

It says here in the flyer that they pay a good salary, and in the papers, I saw that fruit collectors were needed.














































































































Okay. Don't stop.




Connie, maybe it's better on the other side.

























































It's gonna be okay.









































- Okay, thank you, Captain.



















































































It's good that not all of you are hungry.













































































































































































































































































Okay, mom.

































































































































They know you got a good face.



It's okay, Tommy.



























Okay, mom.

I know it's better to go, but I'll stay.




All right, mister.









I agree, okay, and if you don't, turn around and get out of here.








- Okay.

















He left this morning when the salary was reduced.


Didn't he have any bruises on his face this morning?









































The camp committee's gonna visit you in the morning, and that's where you're gonna figure it out.


































Best dance in the county every Saturday.




























- Good morning.



You're a good worker, and that's why I'm gonna tell you.

















































Okay.























Keep an eye on them, okay?






































































I'd like to see how happy you'll be when you and your father settle down in some nice place.




If you hide the killer, it's not gonna work.
Okay, Tommy.





He was a good man.

People who live like pigs, while good land disappears.









































- I'm fine.











Careful, sweetheart. She's gonna be okay.















































































































You have to stay with me. All right, sir.








































































































Very good.






Good morning, Mr. Yakel.
















It's not such a good morning after all.



All right, Mr. Yakel.





































































































You'd better hide.




































































Okay, I'm coming up.

















It's the best wood.



















Okay, we're gonna change that policy.

















Good business is a beauty salon.
































Too good to be true.













































Okay, then, then.



































































Things are getting better.





Okay.









I'd better not go.

























Okay, but you'll remember what I said.














































They're coming for you! - You better get up on the roof!







Okay, where are the grenades?










It would be nice to live in a village. Much better than in this old dug-up town.










Okay.
















































































You'd better get up on the roof. Quick, both of you.
















- Okay.



















Well, good morning. How's it going?



























Okay, you'll sign? Yes!





















Very good.



Okay. We're gonna give him a shot!







































It's okay. It's okay, Mom. Where's my ambassador?
































































That's a good combination. No Mishura for you.













- Okay.




And now it's a good barbershop.




And there's a good view through the ceiling.




























































Excellent. Very good.
Okay.



















Very good. Cream.


















































































No, it's better to go to the open place. The border is on the other side.





































- Okay. - Okay. I'm in constant contact with Marshal Hering in Osterlich.

- Okay. - Okay.












































The very nature of these inventions calls for the best in man, calls for universal brotherhood and cohesion.




























We come out of darkness to light. We enter a new world, a better world, where people overcome their hatred, greed, and rudeness.














- Okay, Jim.


































- Okay.










































































































































- You got a better one? - A lot.







You've become a great reporter, but you can't find better conditions.


- Okay, I won't say anything.

























Okay, okay, I get it.












































































Why not? I feel good with him.












































- Okay. - I'm sorry, Hildy!














































- It was pasturous this morning.











































She's the best.







































- Albany's good for him.




























We'll be in Albany by morning.


























I wasn't a good husband, but I'll always be willing to help.











































































































































Well, okay.















































































































- That's good.



























































































Okay.




Okay. Okay.




- Okay.



































































































































































And this morning, he left, and I never saw him again until the trial, where I appeared as a witness.




- You better go see your fiancé.

But it won't be long, he's on a date at 7:00 in the morning.














































- Do you want to reschedule the execution time from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.?













... at 7:00 a.m. and not a minute earlier.






















- Okay, then read "The Gazette" in the morning.










He's a good man, Hildy.














"And at 7:00 a.m., if there is no miracle, the gallows will help the rebellious soul..."









































































































































































Okay, so...




































































































































































































































































































Okay, but I could have tried.































































































Okay.

















































- Okay.






























































































Okay, look what I'm gonna do. I'll give you some good stuff.













- It's good to be alive!
















































Let's hide Williams till morning, and when the room comes out,..












- Stop talking!
























































- I'd rather have them.










- Very good.



















































Duffy, did he tell Butch to take a cab and drive right away? Okay.






- Is that better?


- Okay. Where's Bruce?

























- It's a good thing we met.










- Especially the finale.































































































































- Okay, give it to me, I'll talk to you.









































































































































































































- Good job, Pete.









































































It's a good thing that we've been cleared of... the painful debt of execution.













































I think you'd better get out of the game.






























- I can finish and leave in the morning.



























































Okay, Duffy.

























































These two gentlemen shouldn't be left alone for long.















































































































































Good morning, Mr Fuller!
Good morning, Miss Hefsiba!

He's good as it is!







Good morning, ladies!













He can handle Clifford much better than I could.
























Good morning, Mr Fuller!













































Deacon Foster came to you this morning when you weren't awake...







































You'd better kill yourself!











Good morning, Mrs Foster. Is the Deacon home?





















































































- Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
























Gentlemen, you can go in there any Thursday afternoon and meet a lot of good guys you've ever met in your life.
















So, you're too good to have a drink with me, aren't you?


















































































































































































































- Okay.

























I'll send a radio telegram to the Habersville National Bank and ask them to send me 5,000 by tomorrow morning to the Whitney Hotel.




I think we'd better go straight to the hotel and see if the bank sent...





























- I'm much better now, thanks to him.
























































Nothing's good enough.















Okay!
Okay!






































































Couldn't be better, thank you.












- Couldn't be better, thank you.

That's good.

I need to know the way when I go there tomorrow morning.





















































































Okay.

You'd better tell me you're still too weak to work.





Wilson! It's good to have you back.

- Okay, it can't be better.



















Not as good as before you left.





There's no place better than home.






















Yeah, very good.

- Good thing I remembered the house, huh?














































































































Red, you can be the best woman.





















































And that's the best thing about you.











Okay, honey?

Okay, Miss Goddess.











Maybe I should come over.

Good morning.





































































































































All right, come quickly.

Okay. I said he'd come to his senses.

- So we better say goodbye.
















































- You didn't think very well of yourself.








I wish you all the best!






















Okay.
- Maybe it's for the best.






























We saw George, it's okay.









Good morning.



I mean, my ex-fiancé thinks we should stop in time. And I agree with him.


























































































Nice piece of wood.





Very good.















































How good it would be if he were a real boy.








Really, that would be good.

That's a good idea, but... that's impossible.


After all, a little bit of good.




















Do you need to learn to choose between good and bad, good and bad?

























And remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.








- That's good. Sit down, son.




And although good things sometimes don't seem very good, or bad things can be good at a bad time. Or vice versa.

I want to do the right thing. That's good, Pink.

Tie it up better.







Okay, I'll just get myself a rock so I don't get thrown on the surface.









































My poor Pinocchio... he was such a good boy.




































































Okay, if there's a lot of smoke, the fish taste better.








That's a good idea.


















































































































I hope you've been given a nice room, 'cause there's a lot of room available right now.


























































Yeah, he was a good man.



























Well, he's not gonna get any better.


















We're lucky to have good weather here.


























You should pay attention to Coach. He's pretty damn good. And you can practice it.















You'd better go to it.





















You're clouding my past better than all the lights of Monte Carlo.










- Okay, Maxime.




















































I'm not the best match for you.









I've been crying all morning, thinking I'd never see you again.





























But this morning, I got word that my daughter was getting married.












































You'd better go, Mrs. Van Hopper.
























Thank you, okay, sir.











All right, sir.
















Of course, you can't see the sea from here. A good view of the sea opens from the west wing.









Okay. I hope I won't disappoint you, madam.






- Good morning.
- Good morning.





















- Good morning, madam.


































- Good morning, Mrs. Leslie.




























- Very good. Thank you, madam.










































































All right. Let's go downstairs and look at him.

If you don't think we're unhappy, it's much better if you don't pretend.


























Very good.















He doesn't approve of me at all. Okay.































That's better.




























Okay.















































































































No one will ever be better than her, ever! She was defeated, not by a man, not by a woman, but by the sea!












































Okay, Frank, I'll look for Maxime.


































































































































































































We'd better avoid publicity, but I'm afraid it's impossible.







You know I'm very good to you, Maxim.




No, thank you, Fritz. And I'd rather they didn't get caught in Mr. De Winter's eyes.















Okay, honey, I promise.










Okay, darling. I don't care about anything but you.






























Okay, you can go.


























































Okay.














I think you'd better go before Maxim comes back.









Things are so much better for you, aren't they?













Aren't you gonna pour some good gas into my car?


















I'd like to live somewhere in the country, find a good place to hunt.





I think we should discuss it inside.















- Okay.






















































































See? That's impossible. She knows it as well as I do.




























But just so there's no doubt, I think I should go with you. Okay.







I'll be there early in the morning.




























































































Let me tell you, blackmail isn't the best way to make money.









































It's gonna be 3:00, 4:00 or 5:00 a.m.










Are you okay?

You see, she thinks I'm the best person in the world.


























Good morning, everyone.







Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.























































- Good reason.
























Good letters, right?












- Yes. Okay. Tell me if I do something wrong.




















































If I give you advice, even good advice, you don't listen.

































Okay, I think we can do this without you.






Good morning, madam.










Good morning." Matuschek and Company."



















It'll be better to put a stop to it.





Okay.
Yeah, okay, I'll text you right away.




















I think you'll be better off somewhere else, too.


















"He's been the best employee for the last five years."


"He carries with him our best wishes for success in his future career."









I had a position this morning, I had a future.


























































He was your best worker.

































































Good day, Mrs. Matuschek.








Okay.

Okay, I'm glad to hear it.




Okay. - Kralik, that's noble.








She's a hard-working girl and a good salesman, and you shut up!

Yeah, it all happened this morning.











It's gonna be okay, Mr. Kralik.


Christmas is coming up. We're gonna miss a good worker like you.
























- Is the news good?






- Good news?
- Very good!

































































- No, I'm not! Okay.

I called the hospital, Mr. Matuschek is better.


- Let's buy him a good gift.

Not bad. But the best gift from us is empty shelves and a lot of money in the cash register.
Let it be the best Christmas Eve ever!






- Okay.

- Good guy.




























































































































































































































































Oh, Michael! That's what you did this morning!






























































































































































































































- Okay, I will.

























- That's a good boy.






























































The day I leave here will be the best day of my life.






































































- Great, great, thanks. - Very good.










One of my best clients.

Font color - " #e1e1e1e" - Okay, take them.




























































































































































































Coffee's good, but you can't make money out of it.























Are they burning up good rides?











































































































































































































































































































It's better at home.



























































































































It's not my rule to let guests in at 5:30 in the morning.
At this time, the best of the best are settled.


























I'm gonna take care of my stuff.

























































































































































































Okay, I was in town.









And as it happens, he's a good friend of mine.







































































We have a right to a better life.









- It's gonna be okay.









































































- How's the good stuff?


- We take fruit all the way and we know what's good and what's not.

There's gonna be a good guy, remember, I didn't hurt you.








































































And even better, believe me.









































































































































Okay, I'll come. I'll just leave early.






















I haven't had the steaks since this morning.




































Three hands are better than two, right?
- Two are better than one.


























Okay.
























































































































Good day, friends.




- Have a nice day.






Maybe you should go back to the house.






































We've been married for eight years, but Lana is the best in the world.




































































































All right, let's do it your way, I'll do it.




















Is he a good driver? - I'm not gonna say bad things about him. But if the road turns where it is, it's a coincidence.



































- Don't you think it'll be better...










































Of course. But you can postpone it for the morning.
I've got a lot of other things to do in the morning. It's very important.


















































































In other words, Mrs. Carlsen, when we spoke to you this morning about your husband's death, your statement was a total lie.








































































































































































































































- Okay.




















































Okay, let's forget it.



All right, let them come into my office.

















Okay.







Although he's good, and I'm not getting younger, I still don't like him.






































































Let me do this.



































































































































God, he was my best friend.











































Okay.






It's good to hug you.










- You're even better.

























Because that's what best friends are for.












Why don't you come over for dinner tomorrow?





Sure, how could I not offer my best friend a drink?





- That's good. - You look great.



It's so good here.
































Very good.




















My best friend.



































































































- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.















































































We should all go to bed.





















































































































Sleep well.
Sleep well!












- Okay, our wife.



















- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

- Good morning, darling.



Tell me, who let you wear my best suit?
- Best suit?

























































- Yeah, I guess that's better.
































































- Can you suggest a better way?




































































































































































Okay.



















































































































































































































- Because we're both good!




















After we gave her the best years of our lives.







































































If they do something desperate, we better go to bed.
- And call the morgue in the morning.










- Okay, sir.
You better get some rest.






































Anyway, don't worry, I'll take care of it myself.































































- It's a nice house.
















































































































- Better here than on the island?























Bill, Henry is our best friend.























Let's roll while we're dancing, okay?




A day we'll remember. At 11: 15 a.m., the Prime Minister delivered a speech to the nation announcing that Britain had entered the war with Germany.













Okay, thanks.




- Okay, sir.

I'll walk. Okay.













































It's okay.



Maybe it's a better wall.




Better, huh?

















































































You better have it.
























Show the girls, okay? How do you make an apes?


















































- Okay. I'll be there in an hour, okay?




























Okay.















I'm not letting you go now. Life is good, just because it's life.












Okay, if we met in the usual way, we'd just talk about the schools we went to.





























- Okay.





























Okay.





Good morning, madam.
Good morning.


I'll remind you that you went to bed at 4:00 in the morning, by the way.





















It's a terrible morning for Roy Cronin.























Okay.
But it's better if you, though, wear a dress.























- It's good to be here.































It's gonna be okay, you'll see.














































































Right. Okay.
















- Okay, sir.

















































Never while he's alive. Okay. Bring her in before you leave.
Okay.






- It's too good, I'm scared.











They have a very good marriage tradition.





























































Tomorrow morning at St Matthew's.







































































She was supposed to be married this morning.











































































































You know, things are gonna change for the better now. I'm just sure of it.






If she asks, take her here, okay?








Are you better, Miss?

You're better, aren't you?




Better?










































































































We're young and we're better alive!








But it stopped raining, and good!






























































Good strong tea.
































Okay.























Good girl.










He's here, we spent the whole morning together.

























































Okay.




I waited all morning, but I went looking for a dog and I was late.

























Roy's gonna lose his head by 3:00 in the morning.




















































































Okay.




Very good, really!


















They're good, they're solid, they're good people.













You're bright, you're good.





Okay. You better get her out of here early before she realizes what's really going on here.




























I thought you couldn't be like... a good wife to Roy.

















































If I..... leave early in the morning.....and I never see Roy again...


Let's wait till morning.































Why isn't it just till morning?















She left me this morning.























I think you'd better know, Roy.











All right, let's go look.





Okay, thanks.





Okay, sweetheart.




Okay, thanks.



































































































Maybe he's in a good mood.

























































































Since my intentions are good,


























I want to give you clothes, good food, a modern house with heating...











































































































So you'd better come.






















Look, it's a good opportunity to play the teacher who always pretends to know everything.




































I didn't say it was good news...























It's so good for you...










































And finally, I get it, the guests are good, and the houses are better.




And now that I've achieved this, the best thing is privacy.




















And better yet, the maid will bring it.



Good day, Your Highness.












































Have a good day.





















It's not good to leave someone who's sick.
You'd clean his shoes every morning knowing you risked finding your toe?
It's not good to leave someone who's desperate.
















































































Yes, that's good.






































- Thank you, okay.







































































































































Which could be better than a glass of champagne to cheer you up.
























A good story never lies.


































































































































Very good.
















































































































Okay.


























I tracked Cornuss' route this morning.



















A foreigner couldn't play Cornuss so well!



























































































- Okay, we're going to the castle.




And yet, this morning, we found all these toys...






























































































Very good.



































































































































- Okay.

- Very good.





























































































































































































- You'd better see your aunt right now.


















Tommy's best friend.
Your best friends are the police.








































































































Okay.


I could have sworn I shaved in the morning.
































Yeah, I wish it hadn't happened, that's all.
I wish the boss hadn't caught you here.




















With your best wishes.























Okay, if you want to.



























If Miss Phelps weren't my fiancée, I'd have quit and gone for a good one.









- Okay, how are you?










All right, keep $5.

















































- You think I'm that good?











































































Very good, Mr. Flywell, you have blanche cards.
Okay, I'll take him.











































































































We were here until 5:00 a.m. We've been looking at the reports.


































































Giuseppe, the best grape-pressor in all of Italy.





























Okay.
Okay.





Okay, okay, okay.























































































































- Okay.

- Good morning, Mr. Grover.
- Good morning.









- It's gonna be done in the best way possible.



















































































You'd better come with us.






Okay, we'll forget about it this time.








































I have a good idea.




























































































































- I think it's best to give him this picture.
























































- Okay!
Okay!




- Okay.









Okay.





That wasn't my best picture.













Tommy, whatever you do, it's okay.











I think you'll get a check in the morning, old man.
































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































- Okay, monsieur, okay.


















































































































































































































































































































































Nice kazak!
Nice kazak!























































































































































































It gives you girls the opportunity to make me the best offer in the next 72 hours.

I have a better idea.

















If anything, it's good.





















Well, good. Very straightforward.







Chicago's fine.


























































- If you think it's better this way, darling.










All right, Mr. Keenan.



























































You'd better change your tactics.





























































































































I'll deliver your daughter to you tomorrow morning in Amarillo at 8:00, single.



















Better do it... in Amarillo.

Okay, $10 a pound, no matter how much it weighs on delivery.


Okay.






- Exactly. - Okay.














- Okay.

















- Okay.










You'd better fasten your seatbelts...




























































































You'll find out in the morning anyway.
I made a deal with your father to take you to Amarillo in the morning.




















Sounds like a good offer.













Okay, I'll give you 3,000... 4,000.






You'd better get some sleep.
We'll only be in Amarillo in the morning.













































One of the best...























Mr Collins, under such circumstances, I think it would be better if you slept where I can see you.




































Better sleep on your side.




Two would be better.





All right, whatever you want.















































































































































































































Look, Pop, I spent all morning fixing your drandulette, and now you want to waste my gas too.

























- Okay.






























































































I'm fine here, thank you.




Okay.
















































You'd better stay here and dry yourself while I check the next tunnel.
































- Okay, eggs.








































Okay.









- You have as good an imagination as I do, Sheriff.











Okay, we're gonna take care of this plane so it can't fly.




Now you better get some food for Joan.














































Yeah, better.






















































































































































































- Okay.


















































































































































































Okay.












No, I think it's better here.

No, I'd rather go back to the old place.






















And I'm gonna be fine in marriage.
































































- Okay, Riley.










And my luggage, okay?











































- Okay, honey.


















Okay, I'll tell you!









































































This morning, Joan married Steve Collins, the pilot who kidnapped her.








Okay, son.















































He was followed by the country's best men, who ran for governor in 1916. The White House was the next step in his political career. But suddenly, a week before the election, a shameful deafening failure.




























- That's a good one. - You just have to find the angle of vision.




















































Okay.


























































- I hope it's all for the best.












































He's got to get a good kick out of it.



























































































































































































































Read the details of what she wrote "The Chronicle" this morning.






























- Okay.







"Cronicle" is a good idea for the paper.
























































These are the best people in journalism.











The good news is, he promised not to send any more statues.
































































You don't have a good cigar? The doctor wants me to quit smoking.



















































It's better to have a competition of flesh and blood.




























































Two years of college for boys.































































































































































I'd say it's a good lesson.
























































- All right, go. Thank you.












































































































- Okay.








































































































































And who wants it when you have your own apartment with a good bathtub?











































































































































































































































Oh, don't report me today, okay?



































Okay.







Okay, then Miss Jones, if she likes it better.


But I told you, there's no... okay.


























Okay, I'll call you that.








Anyway, they want to see you at the department in the morning. I'll come.





It won't do you any good.

Okay.













































































All right, Johnny.
I'll call you in the morning.















































You'll feel better.




























How is he better than me?



























































































Okay, if you insist.





Oh, that's even better.











































































Okay.












Okay!



Okay.





Okay.













Okay. Laundry.











Okay, four and a half.












Okay.


Okay, I'll keep the tapes.
As soon as I'm successful, I'll give you back every cent, okay?
Okay.



You know what you have to do tomorrow at 10:00 in the morning?










































































































Okay.



















But if those words are good, I have the right to say them.






































All right, Johnny. I'll give you a divorce any time you want.





Okay, goodbye.
























It's better this way.






I'm serious, Bart. He's damn good.






































That's very good news for me.
































































In fact, he only reached the best years of his life.











































That should be a good incentive for you to continue.












































Much better than where I got it.




- That's a good idea.






















You better start packing.






























Okay, I'll do it for you.






That's better.











Here. Much better.















Crickets sing you a lullaby, and birds wake you... at 6:00 in the morning.












Okay, I'm coming.















- Your best.








































Oh, buddy, okay.














- It's so good here.


Wait here a minute, okay?
























In short, Johnny. That's better.
























































That's good, we're hungry.








Charlie's the best employee in the state.









Don't worry about it. Johnny's good now.





Start the meal with a good prayer, Johnny.
And finish her up with a good brandy. And then it's gonna be good.































One simple thing is important, Johnny -- some seeds on good soil, rain and sun to grow them, wood for fire, when snow comes, night, like this, of course, a few good neighbors -- all will fill people's hearts with courtesy, loyalty, honesty.















































































































































































I've dedicated the best years of my life to this girl.
She can get whatever she wants in the world! Okay.















What a woman! Okay.














Therefore, this Sunday morning in the great year, the thousand eight hundred and eighty-seventh, we think about life, as exemplified by our beloved Queen Victoria.


























Maybe we should go down to the station, sir.
































Look, I didn't have the best chance.















































When the owner of the best London salon chews you, it doesn't hurt.




































- Oh, my God! - Yes. Okay, Harry, we understand the shock he's had.








Okay. Let's just say that.































































































No, no, it's a good thing you stopped.













If you're on the street tonight, it's better if you don't come back alone.















You'd better take your blouse off.































It'll all go away in the morning.

























































Maybe it's for the best, Doctor.













































No, no, it's okay, Poole.



I see, sir. All right, sir.





All right, sir.























It's a good thing I worried about you.





















































































Maybe it's better than champagne.








































You just deserve better.













































































































































































































































































Good morning, sir.



















































































In a good mood, sir?













































Right, you're such a good and kind gentleman.





































Dr. Jekyll, my best wishes to the future Mrs. Jekyll.

















































































































































































































































































































































































































It's unique, it's the best program in the world.









The best horn in the world! - Hey!












































































That's better.











































































It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.


Okay.






























Okay, well, they made him...





































































From the top to the heels, my baby, you're the best in the world, my baby.









































































































































































































































Better than a plane.

















Magic feather with you? Okay.






































































































They better shut down the company.

























Okay.























If we did that, things would be better.






Okay.











- Okay.




































Okay.























Okay.





















He's good.

















But talking about sightseeings is a good idea.
































The best Japanese teacher is radio.

But a light accent is even better.



And that's good because it adds color.








































Yeah, that's better.
























































The boss is in a good mood today.








Ah, that's good.






























Much better.






















































































































































Okay, that makes me feel better.








That's good.
























































This bus is too good.










































I'll do it best to fasten your jacket. Correct your butterfly.

















































- Okay.












If I want to be a good waiter, I have to remember that.



























































The soup is very good.
I don't care how good he is!










All right, get her some soup.












- Okay.




















Meet my best man, Mr. Bennyster.































- Okay, then I'll find another partner!





















































Okay, Chuck, I'm gonna work hard... but I don't intend to be a refueler for the rest of my life.




- Okay.





























Okay.























































































Meet me tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

























































































- Oin sip, okay.


- This morning.






She'd be better off with a few eggs and a glass of juice.































































If it's okay... I suggest we stay here for the night and leave early in the morning.







It's a good thing we got food.































You better get inside before you get wet.































- Oh, no, that's very good.

















- Okay.


- Okay.





















Okay, I'll be up soon.

























































- Okay. - But I can't.
























- Okay!




























































- Okay.


It's okay.
































- All right, come here!


All right, all right, let's go!






































- Okay.
















- Okay.





































Okay, ham and eggs.

























- Okay, wait a minute.














- All right, let's go, Ferd.











































































It's best to get back to bed.






Camille, the doctor's right. We'd better get some sleep.
















- Okay.
Oh, good!



















Did I fall asleep or did I wake up this morning?















Okay, the room is full of roulette tables!








- Okay.














- Okay.




























Okay.




























Okay, they're... kind and clear... like two water bodies with water.





































































I don't feel good.














































Doctor, I think we'd better split up.








- That's a good idea.













- Okay.











































































Okay.













































You're a good guy.






















































I didn't find any detectives, but we should go.



















































































































All right, let go of your hands.





























































































- Oh, good.




















Very good, very good. $23.


















































Lots of good girls.


- Maybe it's better to wait for everyone to go home.












































I've never met a man whose conversation would be better than food.





















You're so good.


































We should have dinner, okay, woman?











A good worker costs good money.

























It's not more important than good manners.









































































































- Okay.












Now you better get back to the house or you'll catch a cold to death.



- Okay.






































Okay.








Very good.













































That morning, people were happy to climb the mountain.
































Of course, for good, my boy.




























Good morning, Mr. Griffith.














Okay?

Okay?









Good guy.










Prayer is another name for good, pure, honest thinking.

















































Good morning, Morgan.
- Good morning, Mr. Ivans.






























Good Welsh blood and all.



































It's better this way.










































All right, Mr. Griffith, what else do you have?






































































































Good morning, Mr....



















All right, well, get him in position.
Look, to be a good boxer, you have to have a good right hand.



























Okay.






















Really. Nice horse and black suit and a shirt with a flipped collar.
My baby's gonna be good. Here's a glass of smell for all your knowledge.









Every day I make his shoes and clothes, and in the morning they stay where they are.












I want what's best.
If he remains a good man like you and his brothers, I'll be happy.


Then there was good money and fair pay for everything.






















If you're making clothes tonight, let it be my clothes in the morning.



- Okay.
Okay, I'll get my bed.

















It happened to Yanto and Davy, the best workers' mines, but too expensive to compete with poorer and desperate workers.
































































































































































































































- Okay, Professor.






































































































































































- It's better than Charlie.






We'd better get back upstairs.






























Nice! Okay, I know you, or I wouldn't be playing with you.















It's gonna be so much better.














Good thing it wasn't for money, or you'd be broke.













































- Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's worse.












Shouldn't we go to bed?

It's a good thing you haven't been there in two years.




















































Okay, thanks.






















- What? A girl should have good teeth, it'll cost less.




























You better go to bed, Hopsie.



Good morning, Mr. Margotroy.








- Good morning, sir.

























































Good morning.














































































































Well, you finally gave me some good cards.


























































































It would be better not to tell her anything about the whole story.




















































- Shouldn't you ask a doctor?

























- Good morning.
- Good morning, Harry.






















Good morning.















If you didn't lose yesterday, Mr. Pike, you'd better not see it.








- Good morning.






The best of them aren't as good as you think, and the worst aren't as bad.














- Good morning.

- Just coffee. Okay.














































































































































































- Yes, sir? Good morning, sir.




























































I said, "Why don't I get on a tram?"



































































































































































Don't get upset, even in the best families, it happens.


















































































- Okay, m'lady.





















































































































- That's good.















































































































































































Sometimes it's hard to figure out what's best.













































This morning, when I saw him, he was wearing a gray suit and a gray hat.




Okay, Miss Vanderly.







































Good girl.











































Miles had his flaws, like many of us, but there was a lot of good in him.








































































































Okay. How did you get the widow out so quickly?
































Okay, I'll be right there.








































































- Nope. That's good.







You've got yourself a good friend.

































I'll be back with the good news as soon as I can.






Get in touch with my lawyer, okay?






Okay, go ahead, then.









































No, I don't think that's the best thing to do.























Okay.


- Turn right and drive up, chauffeur. - Okay.

Any good news?










I didn't have a very good life.




Okay.























You're gonna have to tell me what you're talking about, 'cause you're not gonna ask me if you're hiding here, hoping everything's gonna be okay.
















































I think I'm gonna have money on my hands, say, tomorrow morning at 10:30.































































Okay, Spade, we're leaving.

But think about it better.

















































Okay, girls and boys, we got this!




































































But it didn't make me feel any better.






















































Good morning.
Good morning.

























That's her third call this morning.



















- Did you see Joel this morning?




























Do it better when you get back.










Okay.












You better hurry home and think about what you're gonna say to the police.












The faster the better.











That's even better.







Okay.






















Okay.
























All right, sir. Where is she?











All right, sir. I have to say, you have a very violent temper.
















- Good worker.































All right, sir, let's go.





- Very good.












All right, sir. What do you think? - I don't know.













Okay, sir, in order to preserve the falcon, at least for the duration of his history, Carilaos again covered the bird with emal.














Okay, sir, they got her, but she didn't get me, but I hope I get her.




































































Okay, Sam.




















Okay, I'm gonna go!








Okay.












Okay, then 26, and the faster the better.







What's the good news?








Okay, darling.
You'd better get something to eat and get some sleep.





















































That's our best bet.











A little better, darling?
A little better.












You better tell him that killing me before you get the falcon isn't part of your plan.







Okay.

Maybe it's not as good as the first, but better than nothing at all.





































It'll be better for all of us if we wait for this time together until the operation is complete.











And we assumed that if we put him away like this, we'd make Miss O'Shaughnessy stop and think that it would be better to share with us everything she knows about the falcon.










Cairo, as you may have understood, contacted me after returning from the police last night or this morning.








































Wouldn't you rather leave the envelope here?















































Good girl.



















































You're a man with good thinking and a lot of connections.


All right, sir. I prefer short goodbyes.























Okay.











































Okay, let's check our feelings, I think you're gonna be gone for about 20 years, and then you're gonna come back to me.




If you're a good girl, you'll get 20 years.



















































Okay!






















































He played with a corkscrew this morning.

- It means, "Camrad." That's good.













































He has a good job in Paris.







































































Better get used to it if you stay.











































- Very good!







- Very good!










































- It's a good thing I have a cabin in the woods.








































































































































































































Get out in the morning, you and your mother!





























































































































































































































- That's good.



















- Very well, if you all agree.































There's nothing better than traveling.

















This is the best room.






























































































- Yeah, go get some rest, my good boy.






























































































































- She said he was a good man, but he didn't understand me.



































Well, not a word if you know what's best for you.























- Very good.





































































- My son, Eugene. He has a good position in Paris.

















- Well, okay, Paris is a symphony.























































I just have a good memory. I said my answer to the school exam.
Since you have such a good memory, why don't you remember where the treasure is?


















































































































































































Okay, we'll figure it out.



































- Okay, we'll see about that.



























































































































- Oh, that's better.




















- Yeah, it's good.

- Very good.



































He's a good advertising agent.

I thought, "Would Kiki come out tonight and walk in front of a bunch of rotos who think that a Spanish wrestler is the best thing in life?






















It's better in black.


















































































































































































You saw him this morning.










































Why did you participate in the search this morning?


I heard you tell Rowbles this morning that you didn't want to go, but you did come.




I know it's best not to let others know what you really think.






















- Your business will only be better.






Good morning to your birthday, señorita.













































































































































































































































We'll find a better suspect.



























If I do this, I'd rather be detained.



If it makes you feel any better, I'll lock you up for a few days.










































- Good guy?
































































You'd better stay home and rest.



- I called this morning.




































It's a good feeling.

















































It's good what you think of us.













I want this town to be nice and quiet again.
























































































































































































































































































































































And yet you and I are in a better position...





















It's due this morning, and he has nothing to pay.
















































Okay!
Very good!










































































































































































































I want this girl brought to us tomorrow morning!







































































Okay, I'll try to find Nasreddin.






Okay, I'll bring you Nasreddin!



















































































I wish I hadn't been born!





















































































But you will believe, Hussein-Huslia, this morning we left our belt in the garden, our favorite belt.










































































Yeah, well, it's a good torture to stretch your teeth, but...


Good torture!



























































- Very good!






Okay!
























What a good torture!














































It's gonna be okay.






















































































It's best to burn alive at the stake!














I'd rather die than know our Nasreddin is captured.
It's better for us all to die than to know that he will be executed, our Nasreddin!








































































































































































She was beautiful, and with such a good husband...

















This was done by a specialist. The work of our city's best jeweler.



































































































I wish I hadn't bought it. Then Madeleine wouldn't have done it.

























































It's a good one.












But we're gonna have to be together from night to morning... from morning to evening.























































































































































There's a lot of good stuff in the shops.





























It's a good thing you're here.
































- It's better for both of us.















































































































- Unfortunately, not very well.




You're young, you're good, you're happy in marriage.

























































Wouldn't it be better if we broke up?



















Good morning, madam.







































































































"Your wife described you so nicely to me that I wondered how best to apply your abilities."























































































Good morning. Please give me the day off.






























You stood up on a cloudy meadow this morning, a shot was fired, and the survivor restored his honor.
















































It's better than here anyway, so let's go.









































































It's better to stay here than run in a tin coffin.












You have good cigarettes.


It's a good tank.





























































































































































That's a good picture.




































































































































































































































- All right, Sergeant, very good!




































- That's good.
- Okay?
That's so much better!

I'll eat oatmeal in the morning.














- It's a good thing the Krauts had mines. - Yes.






























- Okay.




































- Okay, but don't get hot, okay?


























- I can't think of a better education.





























No! No! I'd rather live my life in this filthy hole than run off to fight for something I don't believe in.




































































- It's gonna be okay, Jim.












As they say, "All good things will come to an end."













































































































































Maybe even better than she is.































Ask the restaurant owners. They remember Miss Jacqueline.





























































He's a good guy, miss.

I'm a good guy, but nobody listens to me.









































All right, Mr. Redo.






































































































































































Good people, I think.








































































































































































































































It's not the best.








The book is the best gift ever.






























































































































































Okay.












































































Love and understanding don't make a poet a good detective.












































































































































































You'd better go up to your room and wait for us.

















































Okay, Jason.










Do you have any proof that good is better than evil?



























































































































































































































































































- Okay. It's a little weak, but it's pretty good.




























































































































































Really good. Emeralds are the most beautiful thing in the world.























Okay, I'll go into town in the morning and open the bill.















































I'm sorry your mother isn't better.

















- Best way to commit murder.





































Nice little barn.








































You don't want to read that.






You better go to bed, baby.
















I can't stand the world in the morning.

Well, I don't mind pampering you the first morning, but you're the only person in this town who eats breakfast at 10:30.












A young man called this morning. He said his name was Sin and he wanted to interview us all.

























- Good morning, Uncle Charlie!
- Good morning, Charlie.















































- Good morning, Charlie.
- Hey, Marge. - Good morning, Charlie.










Any good banker can handle this, huh, Charlie?

- Okay. We know what banks are.






























































































Well, okay. But I insist that you wait until I clean up the house.
















































- Okay.



















Okay, I'm sure he's not there.


















Typical family is the best.














































Anna will be better.








- Okay. Goodbye.




Looks like he's a good young man.










- Much better, thank you.

























Okay, I'm a detective, and I'm pretty useless.

































You'll keep quiet because you're a good girl. Because it's so good that it helped. If they knew it was your uncle.















But it's so good outside, I've decided to get some fresh air before I go to bed.
You better go home.



Okay.




























Okay.






































- It's good now.















































































































































I got a better idea when I shaved. Grab your legs.




















































































- The most amazing and the best.



















You wake up every morning and you know nothing in the world will bother you.









































































Good morning, Mr. Sinham.

























That would be better.















































- Simple flowers are the best.























































































Okay.














































Okay.






































































































































It's a good thing I was passing by.





























































- Emmy. To our extraordinary guest who gave the best speech in our city, for this great guy, Mr. Oakley.



Looks like the best of them abroad.


































Okay.




Okay.
























It's better for your mother. It's better for everyone.





















































































What's your name? You'd better kill me.






I wish you'd put so much energy into the fight.






Okay.

















You're better than me.




Teacher, we have a good relationship.


What, a fight means a good relationship?





































That's good.















































Our school will be officially recognized as the best kung fu school if we win. The police are gonna hire my students.

That's what I got this morning.























































One early morning...
























































































































































- Write, okay?





















































































































































































- Pay the bill, okay?



He didn't understand what I meant by you, the best friend a man could have.









Now we're going home, okay?







































All right, give me some more!









































































Okay, then I broke my leg, my shoulder, my head, everything!























Tell Luckini that the papers will be ready tomorrow morning.









I had such a good day today...

- It's the best medicine.


Watch the window, okay?















































































I'm a good actor, aren't I?


















































- Good morning, Toto.














- Very good.












- Good morning.
- Good morning, how can I help you?

































- Okay.





















Pretty good money for the early morning!












































Very good.



















































- That's good.























































I'm good.
- Good?



































































































Make good wine, we're going out on me tonight!








































Okay, I don't drink.

Okay, but my wife has a weak heart, she could get sick.

































- Who's the best driver in Rome?


































































Okay, you can stay here and think about it and talk to the judge tomorrow.












- The end is better, isn't it?




- Okay, go on.







Okay, let's start at the beginning.






- You'd better remember!
























































































Your father's a good man, and I don't hate him...






- Well done, it's gonna be okay.












- Okay.



- Okay, okay.















































































































































Good morning, Toto.

Okay?


































































































- I'm sure it'll be okay.
















































































And now he's probably gonna lose his license, but he's a good guy.






















































































































- The master has a good heart. He'll be a good heir to you.









Okay.










It's a good thing we're together.
















- Okay, sir.


























































I'm his best friend.


You're a good actress, aren't you?


Now you're gonna play the best part in your life.
































































































- I'll start in the morning.





































































































































- Okay.


Okay.










Unfortunately, all the best rooms are already occupied.




















































And maybe you'll find a way to use it. Have a nice day. Thank you.

















- Okay.









I mean, very well, lady.






























Oh, good.












































Isn't this redhead good?











































































Good boy.























Oh, very good, darling.


- Okay.




Good boy.





































Steve, it's me, your best friend.























Okay, George?































- All right, maracas.



















































































The secret to good posture is pride.









































































































































































- Okay.




















































Okay, I'll get you some slippers.







































- Okay.





If you're very cold, you better go home and get warm.




















It's better there.










- He's a good, honest young man.


























































































































Well, anyway, she's doing well with her imagination.


























We guarantee her good time.


















Okay, Ollie.



















































I wanted to be a good girl.








- Good morning, Edward.
- Good morning, Amy.




























It's the best spell against witches.

It's nice and cool here.




















You look good and hot, good and uptight.














































































- All right, then let's go.





She's been such a good girl all day.






























- Are they good?






























































You'd be a good audience.

























Okay.







It's not the best place she should be.






Good story.

























- Okay.


























































- Good morning, Mommy.
- Good morning, darling.









































































- Okay, Amy.











She's very good.

She's good sometimes.

It's hard for her to be good.







You have to put them under the tree until morning.
- Okay, honey.







































You don't open your presents until Christmas morning?


































You'd better come in.



























































































Okay, Amy.




- It's better if you don't interfere.
























































































There's no better time than now.






















































































You're gonna be okay, aren't you?

















































































































Are their rates better?




The Auto Club is a good company, but mine is as good as mine.



- You're a good agent, aren't you?

















































































Sign it, it'll get better.











































































- Better than Walter.


























































































































































It's good here, Walter.



















































































It's better than living like this.




















Everything was fine, except the witness that Phyllis found.














Okay.

































































































































And he could have been better than he looked.


















































































































Better put a finger on the phone buttons for a little more money?













It's gonna be even better with crutches, isn't it?




































































I'm not going anywhere today. Okay.























- You okay, honey?

























































Palo Alto is a good town.





















































I haven't had a longer night in my life. But it was even worse this morning: it was in the papers.





















































There's no point blaming Neff, he's the best agent in the firm.




















































































Good game, Mr Norton.








































Okay.









































































































































































































































































There's a good osteopath here, I'd like to see him.














































































































































































































































Is your plan for tonight better?














































































































He was your aunt's best friend, he'll help you.






















- Okay, Signor Anton.







































































































































Look at this morning.









A play infested with the feeling of early morning.
- This morning.












































I'm very happy with you.





Good morning, narcissists.
Good morning, tulips.










- Good morning.
- Good morning.


Good morning.



















































Her best role.














































































































All right, sir.

Good girl.














It's the best gift ever.





















Okay, ma'am.





























































































































































































All right, sir.
















































All right, sir.





































- Okay, madam.
















All right, sir.




































All right, sir.







































































































- Okay.











































I hope you feel better in the morning.


























































































- Okay, ma'am.




















































































































































































Sir, I don't know what that means, but it's around 3:00 in the morning... I was standing on the corner of Thornton Square... and suddenly I saw our friend again.


































































































































































































All right, sir.





















































































Mrs. Anton, you'd better go to bed.

















































































































































That's good.




























Good morning.



























Okay, Father.















































Okay.




















Goodbye, goodbye.


































No, I think it's best to talk about it in person.
Yeah, much better.


















And that's good.















- He left early this morning.






- Good morning, Father.














The basket is good, too.
































































































Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.








































It's a good bird.



















Okay, Father, goodbye.








































Well, okay, Father.





- Well, okay.


Okay.














































Of course, Mrs. McCarthy is a good woman, but she's still a woman.






- Okay, McCarthy.















































Good?




























You have a good voice, but you don't have to do it like that. It's better to put all the emotions into the words.





















































Being a good wife and mother is a good start for you, as for your mother. But you have to start somewhere, Father. Nonsense.































- Okay, Father.

- He's got a good bass.







































Yeah, maybe he's a little impulsive, but I'm sure he wants what's best.




































































































And he started talking about how good you are, about your successes and how confident he is of you.





























Okay, Father.
















Okay, okay. Take care of it.


Okay.





Okay, but call me as soon as you know something.












Okay.






















Well, if you insist, I'd like to try a little. - Okay.






















































Don't forget this morning's rehearsal.











































Okay, Tommy, I promise.













































Okay, Mrs. Quimp. What happened?

You better, Father.




























It's better now.





















































You have a good piano.














































That's a good idea.



Good morning, Father.


- Good morning, Father.










- That's a good one, isn't it?












































































Okay.




















Oh, that's good.







































































































Very good.











I mean, even though the song is good, as I told you, Father, it's too good for us.




































































































I wish you'd come with us, Father.









- Well, I guess it'd be nice to go for a walk.






















































































But at my age, it's good if you even remember that word.




















But there's good news.
















Much better, Chuck.

Be until 9:00 a.m. my favorite.

You'd better get some good rum.
- Good?































































Nice tile.






































- This morning.






























- Good morning.
















Good morning.

















































It's a good thing your dad didn't see it.


































But I'll be back by morning.
































































































































Good morning.




- Good morning.














































































- No, not wine, better beer.

















































































































Play something fun.






































































































It's a good thing I wasn't around.

























































































































































































































































































































































































The consul wanted to put me in the Ganza theater at any rate, but... it's for the best.






"Good weather and good luck!" Everything.
































Hamburg is the best city in the world, even better than Cologne.











Okay, that's not a big deal.



































































































































'Cause there can't be anything better than a hamburg girl for money.

'Cause there can't be anything better than a hamburg girl for money.



- Okay.







Good weather and good luck, son!
























































































































































Good morning, Lieutenant Bardolph.
























I'm gonna let you out of your gut. That's the whole point.






I'm gonna cut your throat better than today, so tomorrow.




































































































































































































Fathers who, like Alexander, fought hard here from morning to night and hid their swords in the shears only when they had nothing to cut.
































By God, they're gonna blow us all up if they don't follow the best orders.






















Honestly, it's gonna be very good, my kindest captains.









I swear by Mass, before I close my eyes for the night, I will do good service or lie down with my bones.











































I think I'm a good student.







Very well, madam.








































































































And tomorrow morning, we'll drive them further.








It's the best armor I've ever had.


It's the best horse in Europe.
Isn't the morning ever coming?











In fact, Prince, this is the best, most beautiful horse in the world.











I'm afraid a lot of them will die in the morning.






The Dauphin can't wait till morning.















He probably doesn't want the morning like we do.








Give them a good piece of beef and a good sword in their hands, and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.





Singed a rooster, and a sleepy morning clock on the tower was punctured for three hours.

























































We're the only ones who don't want the morning to come.















































But when we're all chopped up, they're gonna buy him out, and we're not gonna get better out of it.

















































































































































































































- Okay.
- Yeah, drink is a good thing.








I wish the Welsh fist would teach you good English behavior.





Well, that's good! I'm gonna be a pimp, and I'm gonna be a pocket thief.

















































































With the permission of your honor, your French language is better than my English language.


































Your Majesty entendre is better than que moi.



























Very well, Sylvia, don't be upset.































Don't forget the first page is written in the morning!




































You'd understand that knowing the future isn't so good.











































































































































You better go home and get some sleep!







- You start her in the late morning...




Tonight was fog, it's cold in the morning...















It was Wednesday morning.



Surprising snowfall at 8:00 a.m. for the season.





...at 8:00 a.m.
















































































































































































Stevens is my best reporter.




You told me what was gonna happen this morning.






















With a good lawyer.























































































































She didn't bring you anything good, did she, Larry?




















Tomorrow morning, Union Bank.





























All right, Stevens, all right! We'll wait at the bank.




















































Better get a boat.



























































That's better.




























I didn't even read that paper yesterday. But this morning...





























































































- Could have been a good reporter...





























































She's not gonna do you any good, Larry.









































































































































































































































No, I'd rather watch him.




















































You're a good customer...

























































- Take them, it's better.








































The whole town's been searching where his best reporter is!

















It's a good thing he didn't know he only had time to go home...



































You have the best sense of sensation in town!













































































































































































Tomorrow morning, Morgan Creek will be...












































































































Okay, but don't be too late, Trudy.

































































































































































































They're all beautiful, young guys, from good families, and we can't send them to death... in the red light of missiles, under bombs in the air... without anyone to say goodbye to them, can we?


















































Okay, okay!












This is the best group of guys I've ever seen.










































Do you realize it's 8:00 in the morning?
8:00 a.m.! Ooh!








































Where did you go with my daughter until morning?


















- Good morning, Mr. Schottish.
- Good morning, Norval.



















It's not bad on Sunday morning, either.































































































































That's good. Tell her she got married, but when she has to prove...




My ideas are probably not very good, anyway.










No one believes in good if they have a chance to believe something bad.















8:00 A.M., isn't it?



- You'd better marry him.










Wait till you get married and have half a dozen daughters... and see what you say when some people bring them home at 8:00 a.m.








I think it's better this way. I have no claim against you.



























If I didn't know you so well... and I didn't know that nothing could shake you... this guy could have sworn, you gave him a hint.



































































































Maybe I can find a better way to explain it to you.


























































































































- Funny thing happened this morning, Norval.










It's none of my business at what time you come home in the morning... or how much you drank...
























































Besides, I've always been a very good swimmer, at least that's what the ones who swim well say.

































































Is it because you brought me home that morning?































































































- The movie is a very good place to do it.









That's good.













Okay, goodbye, Papa.

























































You're good. Sit and say "Uh" and I have to find a name before we get there.
All right, Ignat.













































Good idea.











It's better now.










- That's better.


















- Okay.










































And a small cookbook for you as a gift... with best wishes for those who may have to eat this cooking.
































































































Very good, Norval.

















































































- Nothing but a good kick in the ass.










And you two get ready for good whipping.




















































He didn't do you any good, darling.




















































Dad, that's not good.






The less people know about it, the better it will be for them.




























Okay.












It's a good thing you're not trying to run away right now.




































































































- Okay, Dad. Which side do you want to hit?


























































I gave you very good advice, Norval.
































Nothing's going to cause indigestion, but there's nothing better than plum pudding with tsukats and nuts.
































It's gonna be okay.




















No, no. Aren't you okay?














































Okay, ask her here.









































































- All right, let him out.














































































































I think you'd better let me hold her.
I have to do this, but you better get me to do it.
Okay.



































Okay.














































































Drinks turn a good company into a very good one.


























She was a good girl, but she died.
























































































































It's better to go through the dumpster than get information out of you.




























































- Okay.



















































































































They gave me back one of the rings, pretty good.













































I don't think I'm gonna make a good detective, Mr. Marlowe, and I...




















































































- In one of the best dreams.



















- Good, huh?






































































































































- I'd rather take a nap.















What a nice bed!









































































- You're not well. I'd rather help you.
















































A red-haired girl, a nose with a hump and a good figure.
















































The last time I saw you, I gave you good advice.
































































- He's the best.


















She's been gone since yesterday morning.




























































































































































It's a good place to hide.





























-...because he's done me a lot of good.
- What kind of good?














































I wasn't good, not even half.





















Okay, he's here.




- In the morning.
It's better to do everything until it's dawn.







I'd better not show up until tomorrow night.









Good idea.

























































































You're too good to be some detective your whole life.








He wasn't good at all.





































It's a good move, but it won't work twice.


















































































































































- Okay.




Good morning, Captain Morgan.





















Good for him.




Oh, good.




- You're sick every morning.





- Good morning, Mon Capitaine.
- Good morning.








- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.





Only better.







- Okay.









































































All right, let it go.








































You fish for 16 days, you catch a couple of fish for which... any good fisherman would give his life, and they both lost their lives.














Okay, huh? - Okay, Eddie.








I'll go to the bank tomorrow morning.



- Good idea...







































What time tomorrow morning?
















































We'd better stop them.

















He doesn't think better about you.






- Yeah, that's a good reason.

That's also a good reason... but you're gonna have to get some money somewhere else.










- It's a good thing you didn't give him back.



























































You have a good memory for a drinking man.




I'd forget how good that is.













































You're good, you ran away with my girl.























In the morning.


























































That's good.










































































It's better now.



























































































And you were good.














































That's a good idea.































































Well, you're good.











But I'm still gonna say you're good, and I wouldn't...












It's much better when you help.























































































If only we could find some good poems.
- Good morning, Cricket.

- Good morning, Sucky.

































Maybe it's better this way, Sucky.







































































































I'm better now, Harry.









I'm a good man, you know that.







































































You have to tell me how good you are.










































































It's gonna be okay.

















































































Besides, he has as good a chance with me as anyone else.



































That's good.
All right, Sucky.



































We'll talk about it in the morning.

































Good morning.

- Good morning.









- That's good, I love those.
















That's a good idea.
























You'd better get downstairs.




It's a good thing you didn't put me in a bathtub.









- Good morning, Captain.






























































Your memory will be even better if you get your passport and your money back?
























Better get rid of it.












It's better this way.





- That's a good idea, Sucky.








































- Much better.
























Renard's gonna come and turn this place upside down... so you better start thinking about how and where you're gonna move him.
- Wouldn't it be better to go with you?




























Maybe someone better who won't fail.
























































































































































Okay, Steve.











































































































It's better to leave before we break someone's border.



































And mom's in her best gray muare.





I'll find you a bedroom with a better landscape.
They all have the best landscape.






























It's not a good job, Rick. When you move here, you... you're gonna write your own music, like you always had to do and like you always wanted to do. Stop it.
Rick, it's still better than being a very good critic.









The house is in good condition, no signs of dampness.





























It's not a very good chair.





































































- Very well, then I agree.



































































It's okay, Bobby, it's okay.




- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.












Those who lived there before you weren't very good people.




















Good morning, Mr. Hardy.



















































Isn't that better than reading to Grandpa?






Maybe you should leave the sun.











































I hope you have a good trip.



Okay, soft, but firm.
















































































































Do you have a good iron... can I exchange it for this mattress?












Sleep well.

There's quite a lot of good apples here.















































































I'm glad you're better.
Better?























Very good.








Very well, I know how to do things.



















That's practically the best thing you've ever said.















































You'd better tell the captain.


































If I ever tried to talk about it... I might be better. Did your grandfather tell you why? Cause?

Okay.
Okay. I'm coming.






























































































It was this morning.


























































Okay, Taylor.




































He's a good guy.



















It's okay. It's okay.

Okay.















































































































You'd better drink it.


















































That's a good reason to try.
And even a very good personal reason.





































- Okay. I don't think that's how it works.


- Maybe it's best not to go alone.









































































































But it's better than being honest, which I find unbearable.

























































I was gonna get to know him a lot better, Anselmo...







Okay.




























That would be even better, anyway.






















































































Father better, thank you.
Better?
























That's the story in the paper that morning. A man was killed.














































































I'm a very good friend of his.















































































































































Yeah, that's good.


















































































































And he may have changed for the better.

You made a good try, Chris, but that's not what I heard.





















































































Okay.










I can give you my word. - Okay.
















It's a good thing I remembered your names, Anselmo.














Okay...



















That you were seen on the dock the next morning, that you were nervous and upset.
















































I have a good place to put so much money in the market.



























I take it back, about good, good character.











































Okay.



Okay. Okay.


























You've outrun everyone. Okay.
Okay.




You must be a good detective, Cravat. - Detective?





















No, in the morning.





















All right, jump in.


You'd better call and tell them you'll make it on your own.








All right, Beale!











































Okay, see you later.













































Okay.
Good morning, Martha.
Good morning, Eben.




















Okay, Martha, if that's how you decide to keep this model.






















































Okay.



Okay, and Sunday. Damn it!

Good morning.










Good morning.
























































































































































































Okay, Freddie.












































































Best guardian of the year and of all time.
Thank you, Pat. But you have a better guardian now.







I wish you all the best.




















































































































Okay.























I think it's good.











































































Very good, and you?












Okay, I'll see you later, Cathy.
Okay.
































That's a good option.
He pays good money.



Okay, madam.



















Okay.






Okay.



















Okay.























































That's better.









































Okay.




















Okay!

We'd better get back.


































Okay, ma'am.
















It's okay now.



















Okay.












You're gonna be okay, Mrs. Emerson, and you're gonna be a good wife to Beale.



Okay.







I've been waiting all morning for an answer to my call, and I just got it.























































Okay, Pat.













We were good friends.
















It's a very unfortunate incident, but I think after you deal with Kate's cases, you'd better go to Renault and stay there.




Okay, okay!




Very good.























































Okay.








































You don't have to unpack until morning.





Okay, madam.



























Okay.


Isn't Elma the best chef in the world?






















I think it's the best way to deal with it.





































































Okay.



































































































































































The engineer's gonna tell you better.
















































































- What happens when they find good groundwater?





















































































Morning, noon and night all the time I wrote a book I know all about it:




















We couldn't find anything better.















































































































































I can make Joe feel so good that... when I ask him to relax and take me to Ritz's roof, he says,










But he says he likes someone better.







That's how a man makes a girl realize she's too good for him.



















It's okay.















It's just beginning to get back to civil life and build a better world for a healthy nation as strong as a single family. That's why you have to be more careful with girls. You need to know as much about it as possible.
She's gonna be a good friend of yours, a loyal wife, and then a mother, and don't let the fleeting impulses blind you. I didn't even think about marriage. I know, but soon you'll think about it. I want you to remember everything I told you.













- They like fun days, and that's good.










































































It's not gonna be easy any other way. Thank you very much. I'm... I'm sure I can handle myself. Okay, good night.

























































Okay, I'll wait for you in your compartment.

















Find out if he can become a good friend, not just a loving, serious husband, but perhaps a father.




























































All right, take my stuff to my place. Where's your stuff?














- Some habits can be good.



Right, you still took her home. It was fine until we mixed the drinks. Great, but the vodka after the wine she said, she felt Russian.































































































































































- What are you gonna do if you don't die? I'm gonna stick around.











Your gyroscope better get the plane back to the hangar.















































It's gonna be okay.



























































Oh, yeah, that's very good for the cereal harvest. That's good for Elizabeth Arden. Why isn't anyone driving?































































You know, it's a really good car with me driving.
Much better than a train.
























































































That's nice. Maybe it was even better.

If it happened under other circumstances, you kissed me because we're here on a meadow... in the sky the moon and the stars shimmer, you know, if we could get to know each other better about what we have in the middle of our tastes, our interests, our goals in life.


















































Okay, show our guests, but only good manners... but hospitality is common to Ortega.








You must forgive me, señorita, for my children. As you can see, they lack the mother's care. Dad's been telling me a lot of good things about mom since she died.










- It's gonna be okay.














Well, my eyes are always wide open, and I've studied a lot of books. You'll forgive my remarks, but I say from high age I'd rather get my own experience first and then write a book in life so messed up and a lot more.
Maybe, but it's better to live and create your own mess than hide your head in the sand, Mr Ortega. I see you're educated. Oh, you flatter me señorita so... I seem to have the wrong idea of love.







Señor, we don't deserve it. Don't be modest.









































































































It's a lovely morning, isn't it?





















































































Rusty could have put it better, but what I can do, he still doesn't want to write to you like always, yours, Dink.







I'll try to get you a meeting with Dolores Moran, you have good taste.










I must say, Keith looked great with a black purse and a feather hat. They sat at the best table in La Rue later she danced with a handsome man in military uniform.




Dear Dink, it's so good to hear from you, what do you mean by writing that I'm dating someone?
























So he's got a bright type, I'd like to get to know him better.

Oh, so that's what's good, good luck.



























Oh, yeah, sure, got it this morning you want to hear it?





































































The king got up at 5 a.m., personally wiped the dust on the front stairwell.

































































Then, like you, Cinderella, I raise from morning to evening!

















































































♪ 'Cause I'm good ♪ ♪ I've been kicking my ass in the morning ♪


























We'd better talk about you.


































- Let's listen to him. Good boy.












































Old friends, of course, are good, but unfortunately, you already know them by heart.





























































- Okay.


















- Make sure my daughters are in the book of the first beautiful kingdom, okay?















































And you're thinking about how good it would be to eat ice cream.














Best ice cream in the world. I chose him myself.





I've never met the best in the world.










































Well, okay, so be it, I'll stay.























































































Okay.


















































































































And people, well, maybe they dress me a little differently or something, but actually, they're just like your neighbors and you, I guess, you know, you know them all: cop at the post, kid selling newspapers, shopkeepers, lawyers, good people, bad people.































And one morning, the black headline will stare at us.














































































































- It's not gonna make it any better if everyone's okay with me.

























































And um said they think this guy should have known Lambert's father very well.















































































































Come on, we've got a good cops.
One of the best in the country.



Mac, we promised them a good government.
















Harry knows this case better than all of us.































I want to get action, okay, let the other guy get me.









































Okay, okay, I'll send the car.






























































































































































































It's not good, I'm the one you're hanging around here.















































Good morning.








- It's as good as a night's sleep.





































































And you're tired of free food and advice and you resented people who had good jobs and money when you left the army with nothing.





















































That's too bad." He was a good member of the army.





































































- Okay, okay.









But good politicians, like good boxers, never leave before the final count.











Well, well, I'm always happy to meet a good member of the party.





































And you don't think any jury in the world would blame a guy who gave the best years of his life to serve his country?




















- He's a good guy, Paul.


















There aren't many good and honest people in politics.





























































- I'll wait till 9:00 tomorrow morning.














Well, okay, I'll take John and talk to him, okay?












































































I don't know. I thought I set this case up better.






































































And on paper, it's not that good a look I'm doing, Harry.






















































- I know a guy there who makes a really good coffee.



































































Very good.













































As a matter of fact, if I'm not mistaken, you were so dressed this morning, Your Honor.










































































































































































Mr. Arvy, that was a good performance.
Very good.

















































































We read about you in the paper this morning.









- You know good people.

























































































































- Okay, darling.















































































































































- Maybe the card's been here all morning.




















- Okay.
































































































I have a good memory of faces.











- Okay.






















It's like a bucket. Come on, let's hear some good music.









































































Come in the morning.














































- I think we'd better go to a place where we can talk calmly.





















Taking care of them is the best.























Potato casserole with meat, okay?

























































































































































































































I'll go to Nottingham tomorrow morning.













All right, your guys will recognize him.
































I beat them better than they did me.

































- He was a good guy.
- And it's a good thing he's in the world.































































































































































- Okay.
















- I see it well.







































Good job, she doesn't look like old daddy Pinkie.

























Okay.





























































































- Okay, I'm coming.












At least it's better than you.











You're a good girl.











































































- Okay.








































- Okay, you can pick him up tomorrow.




Well, no news is good news, I guess.
















This time, I'm sure it's not good.









































































































- Okay, I got it.





- Okay.























Okay, Dally, you're just in time.


























































































































I suppose you should stay the night, but I'm asking you to leave in the morning.














































Beckett will bring your luggage in the morning.






































































The next morning, Mark said Jim was sick.


































































































































And in the morning, tell Mark what you heard. Oh, no, I can't.






- Good morning. - Good morning.


That's good.
Good morning, Mrs. Demarest.
Good morning, Angela.






Good morning, Julie.
Good morning, Julie.










































- Good morning, Mrs. Demarest.
- Good morning. - Miss Julie.
- Good morning.



























































































And I thought it would be good for her to have a friend, but on the other hand, I can't shut up about her being unable to control herself.










































I'm glad you have good taste for things.






















So I was still impressed... good, I hope?

























































































































And everything was fine until you arrived.












I suppose... you'd better go.








































I was on the phone with Davenport this morning.





















































































Have a good walk, ma'am.


Okay!









I'll stay here until I feel better.


































































It's a good thing you didn't fall apart.
















The sooner we leave, the better.

I'll take a taxi to the station in the morning. The house is closed.
















See you in the morning.
























I took them to the best psychiatrists, the best doctors.





















































































Maybe it's better that way.







































Even if I did, he might not think I was a good investment.

















Very good.



















































Pretty good, yeah.


























































































































Well, okay.


























































Okay.













































Gemma has a pretty good voice.



































All right, everybody to the fountain.




That would be good.
































But she's got good gloves-- that's my size.

































You don't want to go alone.

















Very good.







Okay.

















I'm gonna put this thing in early in the morning, and in exchange, I'm gonna deliver it to Fenella.






Every morning you leave your little house, you'll have a great diplomat full of contracts and music, and Fenella will wave goodbye from the top floor.




But you'll have a very good life.
Why wouldn't she be good to you, too?
My dear, Gemma, Carol is a good, trustworthy man from head to toe.


































Well, that would be a very good deal.





Very good.






















Well, okay.





Okay.

















































Oh, Sebastian, I think we better find another way.






Okay, I'll go first, then if I start drowning you'll know that.




















Oh, there's a cheap and nice hotel.








Okay.













You're better than him.






Um... pretty good... and not just for the price.

Okay.




It'll make the concert better.








































































Okay, if you and Sebastian can do without me.






























































Pretty good.

















Yeah, I know, but, Sebastian, we won't worry about it if you calm down and write. I know you can-- really good music.
Gemma, darling, to write really good music, I need... inspiration.





















I have to take our fee from the hotel manager this morning.






















































Good music or just a harmonica?
Anyway, if she's really good, symphony, opera.










































Very well, then.



Well, okay.
























































































































Okay.


































































Maybe you deserve a better man.
But I don't need a better man, Sebastian.


































London would be better, I suppose.


That would be a good acquaintance for me.



























































Okay, okay.




















































Okay.




























That's a good idea.









Very good, my boy.






























































You'll be better off.













































Very good.







Honey, I have some good news for you.






Okay.




















































Okay.












His music is always good.



















Okay.











































































































I know you're too good.























































That sounds like good advice, Gemma.









Do you think he's a little better?



























You have to marry Fenella and be very happy and live in a cozy little house, and every morning when you go to work, you're leaving your little house, you're gonna have a gorgeous diplomat full of contracts and music, and Fenella's gonna wave goodbye to you.



































Okay... parties, rooms full of flowers and music, good people.
Oh, good.









I think there's a lot of good in it.
























What do you want, a good marriage, and a good husband--
Now you're using that word "good."




Good friends.























That's better.





















Maybe, maybe, in time, I'll be a good man.
But I don't need a good man, Sebastian.


















































































































































































I had some good ideas.


































































It's a good day, isn't it?
There are no good days in Brooklyn.

















That's a good sign.
Not that I don't think it's gonna be okay, but right now I'm pretty sure it's gonna be okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, you are not setting a very good example for our little guests from school 65.



I think we're gonna start with this two-vote experiment, okay?













































































Just no more than one nail for each, okay?












































































































































































He was in a good mood, by the way.






I'd rather be back on the shipment.









You're gonna be okay.













































































Feeling better, huh?






































If that's true, it's for the best.

































Maybe it'd be better to be interested in them than in yourself.



















You think I made a very good impression?













Okay, I admit I like her.




















Very good, thank you.



Jamie, this is Nick Lombardi, my best friend.

































































































































It's a good thing I went with you.
























And take the best love songs.










You can sing as well as Bing.
































It's okay.






If the treasurer misses the meetings, it's not very good.



Let's drink to Danny's new job, okay?




Okay, I've been dealt with.










































































































































































- Good job.
















































Okay.





































































That's even better.




























Leo is my best student.



















































































Okay, I'll try.





























































Okay.

You're coming to the Cardos concert tonight, okay, Mr. Roberts?



Okay. I'll see you there.



































































I think I'd better go change.






Okay.







- Okay.










He's my best friend, Anne, I...









































- Yeah, I'm going back to England in the morning.

































































































But you'd better hear how it happened.





























I understand that you'd like to travel, but it would be much better to take care of it immediately.






















I thought you'd better take a look at it.



We'll take care of you immediately and you'll feel better.


















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































We need to get pasta, and we'd better get here first.

I'm looking at my brothers. I always don't have a soul when they're at sea. I remember the morning we were waiting for Dad, and he never came back.


















































































But when the time comes, I will find a good husband.

































































This morning in Achi Trezza, young men will have to deal with fish buyers.














Their cases have failed. Only the most useless fishermen are left to work. The best young fishermen were arrested with Antonio.



























And I wanted to be the first person to bring you this good news.









Antonio, you have to eat. What's so good about starving?
















I think with my head, not with my feet. I'm not gonna do anything wrong. But we don't deserve to live in poverty without hope for a better life.







If we worked for our family, we'd be better off doing our job.


































































































It's a good investment, but it's gonna take a lot of money.


















I think you better go, your builders are waiting for you.


I wish you all the best, Mara.







Yes or no? I'll pick you up Sunday morning.




















Why don't you wait until the weather changes for the better?


































































































Don Salvatore is a really good friend.




















We're not the first day in trade either. We know how to tell bad goods from good.






























Good cigarettes.


They're good, aren't they?


























What's so good about the money they paid us for the anchovies?









































Isn't it better to put the money in the box, 'cause then you're not gonna lose it?














So if the weather is good, I'll meet you there at 4:00 in the morning.
















The best thing to do is stay away from Magnivallo, although he usually doesn't walk the streets at such a late hour.




























I'm fine.

If you've decided to stay home, you won't be a good fisherman anymore.



































And here in Achi Trezza, we live, good, hardworking workers!






































Lorenzo, put them all on Menicuccio's team. Okay, Antonio?
It's a good team. Sign up.




















































































Okay. I'll try it another time.



Okay!





I see. Tell him to contact me as soon as he gets back, okay?




















We'd better get back to base if we can find her.










Anyway, I'm much better.


You think that's a good use?
































Okay, if you want.



















I happen to know that he wrote good military correspondence.











First of all, it's not very good journalism.


















You're very good for that.









- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

























































All right, gentlemen.



























































Well, he doesn't work here anymore.





Okay.
























- Okay.




































Okay.


















































































Okay, just tell her her husband's gonna get married.











































































































































































- That's a good conclusion.



























































































She chews tobacco like her father, only better.














Okay, if you insist.






Okay. Just follow her.






























You're a good wife.







- Okay!









It's good, but it's not gonna work.









Okay?

Okay.




























- Okay.





Okay, darling.













Okay, okay. You win.
A signed statement that I'm not married to you. - Okay.
I'll sign it in the morning.





- Okay.















They say truck drivers always find places with good food.













































































































































































- Is that better?







































People are better here.



























































































A legitimate decision is better than what it is, isn't it?






























If he's in the office, I'll bring him some good news. Don't go.
















- Do you have a good memory?
- I have a good memory, Mr. Prosecutor.
































I believe that the question of whether the plaintiff &apos; s memory is good... is of great importance in the present case.













- Okay, I wanted to stay with her...




















- Was he there the next morning when you brought your mistress breakfast?














































































Just keep up the good manners and don't raise your voice.
Okay, where did we get married?




















































































- In the morning, Barrett.




































































































- Okay, I'll definitely tell her.











Kichi, you're gonna take care of the parking lot, okay?


































































Okay.

















- Is that the best you could send?





It's a good thing he didn't destroy anything before we got here.


Bowie, you better fix the tire and check the car.






































Okay.









































Chicomow talks about Mexico like that, it must be a very good country.





















































Okay?
Okay.




Well, okay.














Matty rented us a nice house in Gasherton.






















































Good morning, Mr. Hagenheimer.
Good morning.


- Good morning.


My cold is better today.















And you better hurry up, or I'm gonna beat you.






























You're not okay?









Stop it, okay?













































They're as good as the women I've seen.














































































































Okay.










Okay, Bowie.





















































You don't think very well about how I marry people?














Okay.








- Okay.



Okay.











I have a lot of good friends there.











































All right, follow me.





You see, Alvin, happy customers are the best commercial ever.


















I think it's a good place.




































































But you'll only take a good dog.






You'd better finish dressing up the tree.





























































You better get rid of her.


Okay, I'll wait outside.
















Okay.













































If I found a good woman, I'd take her to Missouri Hills.




































































































- Best plumber around.





































































It's good to wake up and see the sun for a change.
Good morning, darling.
























































































There's a good business here.










- Okay.




















Okay.






































































It's okay now.





- A lot of good friends.




























That's good.

Okay.





























































































































































































Better yet, 25,000.






















I'd go alone, it's even better.





























































































































































Nice shooting, huh?
























































And in the rest of the world, there was too little gold for a good catch.











We're gonna have a rough walk tomorrow, so you'd better get some food.












































The camp's better downstairs.













































But it's better to divide the day's prey into three parts every night.






































Sometimes until morning.

And everyone was so good.



















- Twenty-five thousand is good.


A thousand fifty, and even better than 75.














That's what the wild places are like.











































- You're a good companion, aren't you?









































































































































In other words, do yourself and us a favor. Get your stuff in the morning and leave.
Wherever we come from, with our best wishes.




But tomorrow morning, look, don't look around, okay?









That's why we decided to leave and look for something better.

































Good morning, buddy.























































































































Okay. Okay.


































































You'd better read it.






This year here, at home, it's especially nice.






























I think she's the best woman I've ever known.






































I'll be back before morning.





































































































































Apparently, we'd better split up tomorrow morning. Or even today.







































I'll bury him first thing in the morning.






Shouldn't we leave him there?














That's good.













I think he came back in the morning to make sure I was dead.











































I need a good mules driver, even two or three.
























You can get good money.




We can sell these donkeys for good money, too.






























A good doctor has to be born.
















It's better than writing to her.
































If you knew Rosa, you'd understand why she wanted the best house and as far away from screaming sawmills as possible.




































A tired doctor isn't good.
































































































Sending a telegram to Moose is the best way to keep a secret in a small town.

We went fishing this morning and the doctor left for an emergency call...












































Okay, okay...
















It's a good thing I didn't know about it then!



































It's much better now.










Are you feeling better?
I'm better.






























































































If I don't get out of here, I'd rather die.















































People think a good family doctor can combine medicine and psychiatry.



























































You're not the best gardener.











































































































































Okay, then I'll be straight with you.








































And you don't need me, I'm not good enough!
























































































































































Let's go in the morning and go, Moose.




- Okay...




Good morning, Mrs. Molin!
Good morning, Mr. Latimer!







































We'd better change our plans.



















Not the best weather for flying.

It could be better up there.






































































Okay, okay.
Good morning.

You'd better...


























And why should I lie in this shit when I could have everything you can buy for money, all the best!

























































































































He's interested in my project and it'll be good if he finances it.



That'd be better, asshole.
You're doing a good catawasia.
























































































































































































Very good. Everybody's on fire.


























































































- Like I told you... I have some material. - Okay.
















I hope you get the answer soon. - Very good.










We're fine, we're not accountable to anyone.

















































That's a good idea.


























































































♪ But, best of all, look around us ♪











- How's it going? - Okay.

- Good afternoon. How are you? - Thank you, okay.
























- Again. - Okay.












It's so good to be here all my life.




No, it's better "Ooh, Marie."


Rosa, what song do you want? I don't know, I don't remember, they're all good.





























































As I said, it's very bad, but I couldn't give up such a good opportunity.







- Okay. - All I have to do is wish you a happy journey and good luck.



































But you're a good son.



























Okay, I'm not gonna say that anymore.










































































































You make me teach you a good lesson. Then you learn what's good and what's bad.


















Okay.






























That's better.





























































































































































































Okay.

























































































































































The Stamp of One of England's Best Jewelry Houses!
























Okay! 18 shillings from a gentleman with a good heart!























































- Okay.





























I'd rather escort you!

































It's for the best.

























































No, it's not better. It's her birthday of the 21st.








Okay. Ten pounds.











I'm afraid names are no better...


































































































































































Yes, Mr. Graham told me when he came to see me this morning.















And for the best.







































- Okay.






I hope you're in good shape.










Believe me, you're better than most, but you try to seem worse.
If you try to be better, you're taken seriously if you pretend to be worse - the other way around.





I think we're good friends-- please don't kill our friendship.






























Okay, let's get started.




























































































































Good morning, Lord Darlington.











She taught me to remember what others forget: the difference between bad and good.





























































































She must have pulled a good amount of money out of someone, even though she came to London without a dime.

































- You'll take care of him in the morning.





































































- It's almost morning, let's go...


















































Funny thing is, I'm sorry about the bad stuff, and you're sorry about the good stuff.


























































































































Only a very good woman could do such a stupid thing.



































She's gonna be in your house all the time, and she's gonna be your best friend.
































Everything worked out the best way.






































































Okay, madam.





I know all this, and it's too good.














I know it's too good.
















































- It's good for you, married!






















I had important things to do. I'm leaving England tomorrow morning.






I think we're all good men.













- It's the best joke of the season!






































- Good morning, Dawson.
- Good morning, my lord!










Okay.


































































I was so proud of my memory, and I forgot what happened this morning...











After Margaret left home that morning, she sent me a bouquet of white and red roses... and her fan in a perlamouth box.






































































































































































































































































If only you knew what a good question you asked.











Six o'clock in the morning.





































































































































































It's the best job in the world.
































My best friend works around here.




















Are they good people?






















































































































- Okay.




































You can come tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.












You're gonna make a good master because you like tools.







































































































- Okay, what are we gonna do now?














































If I could wait till morning, I could re-evaluate it.













































































I'm not looking for gifts in this closet until Christmas morning.
I'm not gonna look in that closet until Christmas morning.




- Well, I don't know, Christmas, presents just feel good.










I'll put it here so I don't forget about it in the morning.


















Okay, darling.

















































Of course he's a good guy.











Only better, I guess.





Okay...


































Okay, what now?











Okay.












































































It's better than looking for oil in Texas or coal in Kentucky.




































I'm gonna go look for them in the morning.




Oh, you're so good.

Okay!



























- we met in Crowley this morning.

















































It's a good thing she talks about him like he's alive.






- Well, there's nothing better...
- There's nothing better...


















Okay, start what do you like most about school?





























































































































































































































































Okay.
























I'd rather do that for you. I think I'll catch him at the hotel after breakfast. I have something to talk to Mr Mason about. I'll go with you.




It's much more comfortable being nice to Carl these days.




































































Thank you, mr. It's good that someone knows Christmas is everywhere.
















I know what life will be like with him, calm and reliable when I think about it I get so good











All surprises, good and bad.































Okay, and Carl doesn't have to worry about me anymore.










































But he's been talking about Mr Mason all morning.
- How did you get away this morning...





































It's a very expensive gift if he doesn't know you with Timmy, it's really weird, but if he's just a good guy, what's weird about that?













Mrs. Ennis was sitting on a bench in the park this morning?















About 9:00 a.m. in Central Park... Mr. Mervin Fisher was stunned with a tie and stole a $120 wallet, along with a silver set of salt and peppers for his aunt in Fleshing.
























I was in the park with Mr Mason from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m.









What were you doing in the park at 8:00 a.m. with this guy?





You see, the train arrived early in the morning.








This morning, after his gift was delivered...
Then tell me, where can I get a tie at 8:00 A.M. Christmas?


























































































What's more, I don't want to live without you all these beautiful years. I felt good and bad, but you were with me.


























Daddy, we better go out to the kitchen and get dessert. I don't think anyone's thinking about dessert right now.


Maybe I shouldn't say it in front of Carl and it'd be better if I went a long way and tried to catch Connie behind the kitchen stove?











































Try tomorrow morning.


















Okay, thanks.




































































He's good.































































I'll wait five minutes and if you don't find a better company we can still have dinner.









































Well, if it makes you happy, you're a psychic!

























































































































Okay, what brand?




























































Well... I work in a magazine.


















































All right. Didn't you text her after we got here? Yes.



















































It's wiser in the morning.























Okay.













Anyway, it's a good thing we're leaving before you get involved.























Okay.























I told you it would be better to talk to the patio.








































My husband will write you a check in the morning if I can...




Not very well.













































Okay, how much will you give me?










In the morning, everything will appear in a different light.







The only thing I have to do is get the money by tomorrow morning!
Okay, lady, okay.


















































Good morning, Mrs. Booth.
Good morning...


Okay.





- Okay.













Good morning, darling.









































Okay.











Okay, Joan...















You better give Ruth the good news.






It looks even better on you than it looks on me.
















































































































































Okay.






































At 5:45 a.m.?






This room is very nice in the morning.
















I think I'd better go.




























Where were you this morning at 5:00 a.m.?
Five o'clock this morning?






















I don't care about heights.
It's better to lie in the sun or stick a steak.































I have a better idea.



















I wish you'd warned me.






Okay, let's go back to Pelican.





































Not a good time for husbands.




































Okay, Joan.








































- Okay.


























































I'll be back early in the morning.







It's a good thing one of them has brains.





I'll chew good food, brush my teeth, and shave in the morning.


































































Okay.















Okay, okay.





























































































Okay, you can start.
































All right, let's go.






































It was a very good deal, and Johnny barely kept her.


Okay.
Okay.









My money's not good enough?






"Isn't my money good enough," she says.





























What's good?






Okay, that's the way it's gonna go.




















Okay, let's work clean.























Okay, try and call me back.
























































































Okay.
Okay.





















Okay, I'll tell you what I think.







































































All right, let's go.




Okay.































Okay.




























































































Okay, Ruth. Now that's enough.





























Okay.














































You'd better go, Ruth.











Okay, Captain.








































































- Nice work, Mr Pascal.









































































- Okay...





























- That's better.


















































Very good, buddy.












































































































































Isn't that better?


















































- It's funny this morning we didn't know each other and tonight we're alone in the room.




















- What's good on the roof?

































- He's good, I'll tell you.


- Good morning, monsieur.







- This release may not be so good for our cause.























































- Okay.





















- Monsieur insulted my best friend, from whom I envy, who has many wine factories.





















- It's gonna be okay, you'll see.















































Okay, I won't insist... but it's a shame.
I was told about a good case:































- Good job?




































Good prospects.
























- Is it good?
























































































My job was no better.


































- Okay, don't be late.













































































Okay, I'll leave you to it.































































But I'll never make you happy, so you better go.






















I'm very happy with you.






























There are better things.
































- Very good.
































































































































































Ready. But you'd better calm him down. He's gonna make a noise.




















































- It's better for everyone, believe me.









That's better.















I think it's a good start.



















































































- I knew you were a good man.


































































































Much better.







It's okay.


- It's better by the water.




























It's gonna be good.















































































- Oh, good.




















































































































































































































Okay, yeah, I think I can.
















































































































We knew each other so well, all of a sudden, we didn't think these years were just in between.




































































































I think I'll continue in the morning, Miss Layton.
All right, Mr. Justin.









# The first is the best love in the world


























































Good places?





















I'm sorry it came out this way, but I think you'd better know the truth.














You'd better go.

- You'd better go, Stephen.










- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.




- Good morning, Mr. Stratton.









































Okay, you can love her, but you don't know her.
























Okay.










It was better.


















I'm not a very good person, Stephen.






















- Thank you, okay.

- Good morning, Mrs Justin.





































































































You'd better put on your shirt.




























































Was it hard this morning?































I think it's better to deal with me than Arnold.














"I suppose you know me well enough to understand... that I will never allow any influence on me in this or any other matter and especially... in the financial aspect."























































He left this morning.















































I'm sorry, Mrs. Justin, but I think you'd better face the facts.














- I called him at the university this morning.




































































We... better say goodbye.


- Okay.








































































It's okay.





You better sit down.

It's okay.














































- Okay.




- Okay.





























Poor people should die early, they're better off.































I'm fine.





















































































Best wishes to your father.







- Good morning.
- Good morning.





- I'd rather have tea.








































































































































































Okay.




























































- Okay.














































































































If we start treatment now, he's gonna be okay.



















I thought you'd better explain yourself.












































































You'd better go home.











































































































































































































Okay.























































- All right, Sergeant Major.






All right, Sergeant Major.






























Try and get him to meet Sammy tonight, okay?





















































































































































I don't feel any better about what the doctor says.


















- You think it's better?














































- Good morning, Crowhurst.
- Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Rice.























- Okay, darling.





























































Good girl.



































Good morning, Lacomb.


Good morning.

- Good morning, Mr. Pinker.
Thank you, very well. - Great.




- Okay, come on. And a thick soup and a pint of Hollyster, please.


























You had a good division when it all started.


































































































































































Very good.


Ah, good morning, gentlemen.






- That's the best we could get.











It's better now.





































I wish you'd come up with a thing that would write good speeches.

Oh, that's even better.
























You'd be as good at it as anyone else, even better.




















































He came to consciousness for two minutes last night, and for a few seconds this morning.























































If you have something, let it be the best.




- Okay.











Okay.










































































































































Okay.





























A big garden is the best puncture capacity, maximum interval.














































































































































































Okay.





























5 : 30 a.m.









































I wish I could take a look at his notes.





















Well, okay.































I think I'd better pull the switch and watch.



Well, guys, unless there's a man inside with a burning match, it's okay, I think.


















Okay.




























- Okay.






- Good day, sir.


The sea isn't as calm as it is this morning.



















Wave if you can hear me, okay?






































































































































I promise you, it's gonna be okay.








- Okay.
























- Okay.










































In general, the good guys are doing everything they can.




















































Best friend I ever had.











It's the best thing that's ever happened to him.
































I love good westerns.












A very good writer.































I know a good dentist.




























This is the story of a man who's punishing a sheriff chasing his best friend.














I think best friend, except for you, of course.



































































You'd better think about yourself.



I think it's a very good cover.

Major Calloway sends his best wishes, sir.

























- Okay.









































































It's better not to get involved in these things.

























I should have listened to my wife, she said you didn't have any good in mind.




























































































































































































Yeah, he turned his head, and that's a good picture.
















































































Good girl, but she should be careful in Vienna.


Okay.







Okay, I'll be back, but...










































I knew how to knock the temperature before the exams, how best to hide the vagina, how to get away from something.












I think it's a good idea.


If we need to meet the concierge, we better go.
























We'd better not see each other.


























So, ladies and gentlemen, it's all good that ends well.






















































































We've got better witnesses, take a look...









We'll send him to your hotel in the morning.










































It's better that he died.









































































































I wish he'd really died.










Okay, I'm crazy, I saw a ghost.











































Old Lime has better things to do.


















































But the dead better stay dead, they haven't lost anything, poor people.









































































































What good have we done him?




















































- Okay, sir. Don't tell me you're doing this for free.




























































































































































































This one's good.















































Okay, let him come in.


I've made inquiries, he's from a very good family.





Okay.













Okay.

























































































She's getting better.


















































































































































Okay.























































































Well, spending money would be good for him.




















All right, take the money and have lunch.
























All right, how dare you lie to me?























Good morning.














































































Okay.

































Okay.






Okay, okay.




















Okay, I'll talk to you.













All right, go, go.




















Good morning.

















































































































































































Okay.
































I'd rather work than go to school.

























































































































































That's a good idea.







































































Good plan.












That's a good plan.



Okay.





























































































Okay.
Okay.


Very good.




Even better.













































If you were a good boy, you'd go home right now.







































































They may just stay home, but they'd better stand here and starve.















































































Okay.
















Okay, I'll tell the teacher.






















































All right, go.
























































And Chang, be a good boy.
























































































You're in too good a relationship with the police.



































































































Okay.












































































































































It was better to wait a day.



















































































The worst of these phrases is much better than any of my poems.







































You'd better lie down and close your eyes.










- Okay. Can you get the car out?






- Very good.












































No one knows this better than you.

Orpheus sent me these texts yesterday morning.


























































































Okay.














"The morning of the young widow is fast as a midday candle."





















































































































































































































































































































































































How good of you to come.




























It's better than blinding yourself... or losing your leg.










































































































































































































































































































You can't stand here. - All right, Sergeant, I'll be right out.























































































- It's okay.















































- How's the fish now? - Okay.



























The earth is good, it'll be fertile again.




And to your good land?



















































Yeah, we left. America is good for young people. I'm old.









































































- Is that good?







































She's not a very good woman. She doesn't have a reputation. It's okay.




















































- Okay, okay!


































And this morning I got all this junk again. That's creepy!















































































- A little. We caught tuna this morning. - What's this?














































































Instead of giving birth here, it's better... stop it!


































It's good here, isn't it?
















































































































































- But you wanted to stay here this morning.
- It was this morning.


- There's the best trackers in the world.




- Only I've heard there's a good track in America, too.






So let's go where we're better off.



















So I'm gonna stay here, talk to him... and then I'm gonna catch up with you at the station, okay?
- Okay.










































Well, since it's gonna hurt you, tomorrow the banks are gonna open... I'm gonna pay what I can, and I'm gonna work the rest.
























- I sent all the strings to my best friend, Claude.
























- Your cargo arrived this morning.



































- Yeah, we're really good friends.













It's good to know about your friends.




















- Under a good one.




























These are very good napoleons.





































I see you're a good boy.









And I have some good news for you.




- Okay.















- But that was good of me.

























































































This morning.












Paulie's a good teacher.
















































































- Okay.






































- Don't look at me, okay?
- Okay.





























































- Of course it's better to stay with Paulie... but I want to see what's cooking, too.
- Yeah, you better go and see.































- Okay.































- He's a good jockey.



















- I thought you called George a good jockey.





It's good that by their rules, you can get your bet back.










- It's better than kicking your ass.





































Did you forget all the good stuff?



















- Joe, Joe, that's better.





















- I'm sorry, Dan - if I said something wrong this morning... but you hit a kid who just told you the truth.








































You're the best player, Daddy, and you smiled at your luck.






































- All right, let's talk about the horse.










He's got good taste.












































- Okay. But I have a surprise for you.

















Now I'm in a good mood, Danny.














- Okay.







































- It's funny to hear it from you... after you say it in the morning:

































I'm the best guy you can fall in love with.














































































We'd better go, Joe.
Joe, your dad made the best ride I've ever seen.























Well... if that's what you want.





Okay.









Okay, lady.















If you know what's best for you, say it.


































































































































































That's better.










- Not very well.










Wherever you are, you always attract the best society.

































































































































- Feeling better?





















You'd better do something about it.















































































Okay, put her through.











Very good.



























Very good.




















I know you, Anne, better than you know yourself.











It's better than stealing than a nervous breakdown.










I woke up this morning with a brand-new woman, like nothing ever happened.




































- Hurry up, okay, Vincent?



































































































All right, Bob.





































































































Pretty good marriage.








































Okay.







































































































I'm your friend, as good as a lawyer, Bill.




And our only best defense is insanity.
































I wanted to call her this morning before I read the papers.











































We'd better think about getting the doctor to sleep.









They look like this lady, okay.
































































My husband is a very good man.
I don't think there's a better and a nicer one.







It's better if he divorces me.




































I saw you... this morning, I think.











I understand you had a conversation with her husband this morning.





















You'd make a good prime suspect.
Even better than poor Anne?
































Okay.












Okay.







This morning, when we discovered that the footage was missing from my office, I knew immediately who took it.

















It would have been a good line of defense if you had figured out who the killer was.



























Okay.























Daisy told me the police came this morning.






There's a new article in the papers this morning that the police suspect someone other than Mrs. Sutton.














































































































































































- She'll be working tomorrow morning.







































- It's better if we help you.

















It's good to have a wife who comes back to your house.



















































































You're Margot Channing's best friend.




The best.







































































































































































































- But you're better.














I think I'm better... I don't have words to say how happy I am.






































Then why? You're the best, the most successful director in the theater.
































































































































Let Miss Brown take the dress.




































You could've played better. Yeah, okay.











Okay. - How's she doing?























Good morning.


















































































































































































































Why don't you bow down?


If my guests don't like it here, take them to the maid's room, they'll be better off there.

















Max, darling... one good sip and you'll get rid of this Miss Kaswell.





























I don't think that's a good idea.


















Okay.










































































































I agree. To be a good actor or actress, you have to want it more than anything in the world.



























- That's a good idea.

























































































Are you feeling better, darling?





































































Better be Byemond and Fletcher. They died 300 years ago.













































































I admit I've had my best days, but I can't be bought for one cocktail... with a salty peanut.























































































































































It doesn't matter how many careers we've had before. There's nothing better:













It's a good thing she invited me... and a few other journalists from other newspapers.


It wasn't just good, baby, it was a real show.







Patience and hard work, and you'll be a good actress if that's what you want.



























It's a good thing they didn't throw anything.






















Or should I pretend I'm busy? Let's leave it.






















































It's even better now.












It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.




















If we make a good choice of actors.























Okay, about 12 o'clock.


















































































You know, I always thought I was a very smart girl, I was sure I had a good head on my shoulders.














But I have some good news.














































































































































































Tomorrow morning you will have your seat on the banks of immortality.


























































He's gonna write his best plays for me, and I'm gonna make them great.





































Okay, let's be straight, though I think you already know what I'm saying.





































































This is gonna be the best performance of your life.
It was her best play.



















































Okay, I'll give you a ride and go to the party alone.




























- The maid will clean up in the morning.












































































































I think it'll be the best punishment.





















































































































































































Okay. What other problems remain?











Lewis Cjavelli, he's the best in Chicago.




















Of course, it's best to stay out of it, but... I know serious people who might be interested.



Okay. One more thing.















- Good day, sir.




















Go around my debtors, starting in the morning.








Yes, I will. Okay.












































































There's the best water in the whole country.




































































Okay.



























































Okay.


















Good job.










































Gus thinks he's good, and he's rarely wrong.



























I met her on the street this morning.


























Okay?













- Is the boy better?
















Okay. We'll see Emmerich right after the case.









































Okay.












That's not very good.











That's good, we're done.

- Good job.

















It brings me to a good mood... which gives me courage.




































































- Okay, Mr....











































Don't worry, Maria, Lewis is gonna be okay.































































Okay.




























His body was caught this morning.



















He was killed early this morning.






























Tell me I was with you... between 5:00 and 3:00 in the morning.





- Okay, call me later.


































- Okay, we'd better get out of here faster.













































































































All right, go to Camden Street, 4117.

























































































































Mr. Emmerich was here on Friday from 2:30 in the morning.












































How's your head, Doc? Okay, as far as possible.






























You'd better turn yourself in when you're caught.
That's right, that's better.























- It's better than a train.


















She's in good condition.























All right, get your suitcase.



















Come on. - Okay.


- Mr., we'd better get going.
























































































































- it's gonna be okay. - Oh, my God.
If dad didn't sell the black stallion everything's gonna be okay.


























So he remarried... to a woman from a good family... who had two daughters, one with Cinderella age. Their names were Anastasia and Drizella.



But, no matter what, she still remained as kind and sweet, and every morning gave her a new hope that one day... her sweet dreams would come true.

I know, I know, it's been a great morning, but... it was a beautiful dream, too.
















































Jacques, I think you'd better tell him what's what.







That's better.



Well, that's better.

















































So if you don't want to lose a warm bed, you better get rid of those dreams.



Lucifer has good sides.



But there's got to be something good about him.

















































It's the same thing from morning to evening.







Good morning, Drizella. How did you sleep?




Good morning, Anastasia.





- Good morning, Mother.














































































































































































































































- Okay.



























Okay.
































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































I assume you decided to take this little vacation only this morning at 9:00 a.m.?





























Let's go get a drink with Eddie. Okay.



The air conditioner is so good.









































Nice room on the sixth floor with the bay windows. He's a porter. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey


























































































- Come on, let's go. - Well, okay. I know what it's like to be alone in a strange city.



























Yes, Mr. Wallace, I'm leaving here in the morning.










Hey, you're good.
My wife is a good dancer, isn't she, Bigelow?



Okay.















































I like the good company.




Okay, where?

















The heart, too. It's a good thing not everyone has the same health as you, Mr. Bigelow, otherwise the doctors would be out of work.







































































































They checked out of the hotel this morning.






































Okay.









































































You really can't brag about good manners, can you, Bigelow?

















































You assured the document one morning before I came to work.






You also said that this Reynolds guy made some kind of deal in Palm Springs... and stopped by your office early in the morning, on his way north, to notarize her.






























































He met her yesterday morning.



He'd been asking about her for months, looking for her, and he found out where she lived yesterday morning.


































































That's right. Honesty is the best policy.

But in your case, since you're a good friend of Mr. Reynolds...


He must have come for the photo. But he can't be your good friend... because his name isn't George Reynolds.





It's a good picture, isn't it?






































Of course, I'll do it, and we'll lose our best client.












































































































- You'd better come back, believe me.



















































I told you everything this morning. Yeah, I've told you enough so I can follow the wrong path and not know Stanley's the one I'm looking for.






























You'd better listen to me. You have to give me a chance.



































I think my sister should be happy to see his brother at his wedding in the best outfit.





























































You'll tell the Bank that I have the best of the best at Furies.

















- Clay, you need to learn good manners.














































All right!

























































All Furies are yours, okay.














I printed them on the best paper from Washington.










It would be better if I discussed this situation with Mr. Anaheim.





















































What do you think, you're the best man in God's world?
- You know someone better?

































Okay.









Kiss your best friend.














































































































Maybe it's for the best, she'll calm down.







- Okay, Mr. Darrow.





















- He's too good for that.




















































































































































































































Okay, don't look for him, I brought some with me.























































































That's it, okay.

- Okay, son.
















































































- Okay.








































Okay.



And so is your good friend when you realize it.
















































I always said hot tea was the best woman's ally against rain.













































































































































Okay.

Okay, now you can come out my brave men!





















- Okay, I'll beg.







Kiss your best friend.





























































































Okay.

The sooner the better.








































































Have a nice day.



























Okay, darling.





Okay.



















































































































He's the best I've ever worked for.
He's the best I've ever seen.
He's the best I've ever heard of.
















































































































































































































I thought the boy liked to feel better about something.











Well, Clyde, Bart and I have been best friends since Bart got to town.
























































I'm probably the best shooter in Cashville.









































I don't know why... but I feel so good when I shoot him like I'm someone very important.







And it's my responsibility to decide what's best not only for you... but also for the society you live in.





























Okay.





























































































Okay.







You always have a place for a good man, don't you?













































































































Bart, I wasn't good either, at least until now.

Okay.





















































































































































































































































































- Okay, darling.













- It's better than three months in prison... in separate cells.

























































































- Okay.





























































Okay.

We'll buy ourselves a good ranch and settle in there.














































































I wish you hadn't called me.














Okay.









































































Bart, it's so good to be so close to you.


































































































































Okay.



























- That's good.

Okay. Give me a paw. Careful, don't fall.













Thank you. He decided to come here this morning.















































































































Harvey, I told you about Aunt Ethel Schoven. She's a good old friend of mine.



























































































Okay?


























































































































































































Okay, honey, but hurry up.







































































- Okay. Goodbye.



Mr. Dowd, I take a bath every morning before work.













- I want you to meet my best...






















After all, it's for the best.



































































Let Vita take care of it.























- Yeah, yeah. - Okay, I'll see you later.

















































But Harvey's not only a fart, but also my best friend.




Do you think, Mrs. Chumley, that's not very good?





































- Okay.























































































































































































































































































- Okay, Doctor. Why did you send him away? Why do some people stop others from getting to know each other?






There's been an unfortunate mistake this morning, I've already fired my assistant...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Please, you can just-- - I'll get in touch with you in the morning.





















- Okay, fine.


















It's gonna be okay.














Okay. Hello.




































- Okay.






































- Okay.















































You know, Doctor, after what happened this morning, these flowers should be from you.












































Then her companion led Dr. Chumley back to me and Harvey and explained that it would be better for Dr. Chumley if he... stayed out of it and took care of his business.


























But at least one sound, hmm, and you're gonna get out of here. Okay. Keep dancing.




And Dr. Chumley better be there, buddy, or it's gonna get worse! - Mr. Wilson?

















Maybe it's better to go somewhere else.




- Okay, Mr. Dowd, if you like.




- Okay.









- Okay, if you'd like.





















There's a little envy in even the best of us.




















































- Okay, Lyman. I'm just afraid I won't be able to stay long.



















































































- from Cleveland this morning. - And she did it?

































































And my sister did all this one morning?











Okay, thanks.














































- Yeah, thanks. It's okay.







Dr. Sanderson, please don't give a shit what I said this morning.











An element of argument in any conversation is a good thing. So everyone's taking part and nobody's gonna throw it away.








And this rabbit thing must be a good thing.




















I wish it wasn't tomorrow!









































































And there's my good friend Judge Gaffney. - Hey. Hey.









































































- Okay, honey.







- Vita, it's okay.







Okay, Vita. Wait, I'll take the hat and the coat.



























































Yeah, I'll put it in the front. Okay.


























































One day I'm gonna surprise everyone by writing something good.































I'll drop by in the morning, wake you up at ten o'clock.











































































































































He's good, he's self-sufficient, he's very calm, he lives with his parents, with a good job.










Okay.



And good luck to you.






























































































































































How would you feel if you had to go in for questioning at 5:00 in the morning?







But he was a good officer and the subordinates liked him.
















All right, sir.












































But, of course, I'm a better storyteller.




























- Hello. - Good morning.





















It's a good thing you liked my face.
















It's a good thing we didn't make it.































It would be better to meet in a more favourable atmosphere.







Okay.












First thing in the morning, he came to the station.



















Okay, go on.






























































Okay. But to me, you're more attractive, even though you're less intelligent.




Okay, Martha, I'll see you in the morning.


















































































































































































































He's a good businessman who wants to get married.
You'd better think about being thorough.










I took it this morning.













































- Good boy. - What did she take me for?

























Maybe it's for the best.



















































How do you like it this morning?












































































































A good love scene has to be about everything but love.


























That's the best.

Effy, it's okay. You can vacuum both apartments tomorrow.













I'm only gonna teach the kids what's good.
























He's Deeks Steele. And if you love him, you have to accept the whole thing with the good and the bad.









We have to wait until something good happens.











































































I took him this morning.













































































































Okay, I'll take the ring.

























- Deeks, I've been looking everywhere for you. I have... good news.






























Kim was willing to risk everything for a copper coin... or a good friend.

Very good.

Good boy.
































He came to us the next morning...









































































































I often didn't find good food for you.



















Return to the path of knowledge... and then, son of my soul, you will be ready to enter... a new, better world.





























































- He was a good guy.
- The best. I'm gonna miss him.













I know you want to see him, but isn't he better where he is?











Happy is the one who's considered the best in his business.


















































































































That's a very good argument.





With good equipment and your help, we have to make it work.














































Because it's better to go on the road with the person you like.


Okay.






















I'll meet you at Mr. Eric Masters' office tomorrow morning.




She's a good woman.






































































































































































































If we have to stop here, we'd better put it in the shadows.













Or it's better to make a stocking out of Alan.








































































Good idea!

- Good idea!





































Okay.










































































That's good.
























You don't have anything better than that either, do you?

















































































- Okay.








It'd be better if there was a water well here.





And you, I see, are in a good mood.


























You didn't love Henry and you didn't treat him very well.
































































You'd better keep your weapons ready.

















- Nice shot.


















Take a deep breath, okay?



The sooner we get out of here, the better.




























































Okay, be there.

































































































































































Okay.

Okay, then.































I'd rather lose her than a horse.
























































Dogs are better in this world.





















































































































































































































A lot of married people don't know each other any better.













































































A new place, no better and no worse than anyone else.

It's a good thing we're gonna stay... good comrades.
