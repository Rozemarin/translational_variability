Like a month ago, Jeff had the kids.
My kids.
I only think about the kids.
All for the benefit of the children, huh?
- Kids, please.
Mom, do you want me to make spy out of my kids?
What the hell are children doing...
These children must be punished, and they know it.
Kids, servants, jerks, no time to drink coffee, my best pipe was stolen, my stupid razor, my pen is running, and for the fifth time in a row, we had tapioka pudding!
And children and servants, and...
Kids!
Run, children.
And the kids, darling?
Todd, you need to get married to have your kids.
What manners, children!
You've eaten enough, children, I think.
Kids, let's play one game.
Where are you kids going?
You think I'm gonna be able to leave the kids like that?
It's okay with the kids, except you and Todd all over the place, that you encouraged them.
You know I'm their mother, and they're my kids.
After all, well, they're my kids.
Kids!
Didn't you call Jeff to find out about the kids?
What else did the kid tell you?
He's still a puppy. The baby.
The baby...
You're just a helpless kid.
Did the baby fall asleep?
Jerry, don't wake the baby.
"Don't wake the baby."
He's such a kid!
But the cute kid?
You're so young, Junea, you're a child.
- No kids?
- We have a kid at home.
No one cares about the kids more than I do.
We can hardly force our guest to take care of the baby tonight.
She seems... scared of a kid.
You know how kids know how to...
Klaus Bleaker's wife and children don't have a home except for this farm.
And then we found out Johanna wasn't gonna be able to have kids anymore. That I wouldn't have a son... that after me Van Raines wouldn't be, that I would be the last.
And I hope my child will believe!
And in the baby's heartbeat, it's uneven.
I'm terribly sorry, but at least your wife has recovered well, and in time, you may well have other children.
You've always been a good kid.
Now we're gonna have to put up with this kid.
I so want you to talk to this kid.
And you call her a child? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
All children
I heard an Indian legend once. About the way the ancestors light fires in the sky when the ruler's child dies.
My dear, in the presence of the children, I've already asked you to...
Often, when children see a stranger for the first time, they make a scream that scares adults; they don't know how to reason, but they feel right.
This gift was given to me by the children, the only friends I had there.
If I told you I knew a widow, a mother of four hungry children I wanted to help, I wouldn't have to believe me.
- My children, please; such a lovely day.
I love kids.
I drank her movable property, her marital bed, my children's clothes.
My children...
Ah, my children, a loving father has the right to bless you.
Don't you want to give birth to crazy kids?
As I continued my journey, I met a very poor woman who held a child in her arms.
The baby just smiled at her the first time.
"The joy that the mother feels in front of her child's smile is as much as the joy of the Lord every time he hears the prayer of a deeply sincere, prayerful sinner."
Oh, my children, don't be so annoying.
As long as I'm alive, the fate of my children will not be determined by ditching.
Like a child.
Why is the baby so helpless?
Why don't they ask the baby?
Yeah, but he believes everything so sincerely, like a kid...
I can't. They have kids.
These aren't my kids.
Yeah, but they're their kids.
You have no family, no children.
Wait for their kids to grow up and leave them?
Mary, give me the baby.
The kids are coming with me.
If you have children, there won't be ten left.
I want my baby to look like you.
Mary gave birth to two more children, but she found time to work as a volunteer assistant.
Why do we need these kids?
So our children can have such silly and careless teachers who send them home naked?
Maybe my kids aren't the best dressed, maybe they don't have any good clothes...
Why are you tormenting kids?
It's enough that she's humping around with your stupid kids trying to teach them something.
My wife, my kids, my friends.
He's like a kid.
He poisoned the baby.
I'm going home. I want my wife, my kids, you know?
- Ernie Bishop. You live in Bailey Park with your wife and kids.
My wife ran away and took the baby with her. I've never seen you before in my life.
You don't have kids.
Where are the kids?
Where are our children?
Get me back to my wife and kids.
Kids!
Kids!
But we have to think about the kids!
No, I don't. We don't have to scold the kids.
You know how noisy these kids are.
She wants to find herself a party. With two kids!
But I'm in a hurry to pick up the kids.
Before I leave, because you refused to come with me, I want to be sure of my children's stable future.
Ginna, isn't it paradoxical things that happen between parents and kids?
Definitely, you were a model kid.
Later, children.
- I'm not a kid anymore.
I want you to meet the kids.
- Remember, kids, just one at a time.
The house, the children, my mother.
- Did you like my kids?
They're your kids.
All right, kids, go to the hall and have some sandwiches and juice if you want.
Good evening, children. Happy New Year.
A friend should have come to me right away, not spread rumors that even children could hear.
Now, go to the kids, my dear.
When the poor mother expected another child and needed shelter, she stole a piece of bread and went to prison.
She stole 11 grand, served 11 terms, and gave birth to 11 children. Then, unfortunately, she had to steal the 12th, serve a new term, and produce my humble person.
Any child will tell you where the castle of the Marquis de Pierreon is.
Come on, kids, get changed for dinner...
Kids are born in a hospital.
As that French guy wrote about the kids looking for a blue bird, they were looking for it all night long, but they never found it.
They admired the forests, the rivers, the lakes with their wives, their children, their houses, then they looked up to the sky, and they said,
You must forgive me, se√±orita, for my children. As you can see, they lack the mother's care. Dad's been telling me a lot of good things about mom since she died.
- Sit down. - Thank you. You have wonderful children, Mr. Ortega.
There's your kids!
She's not upset that she's in the middle of a newspaper scandal. She's still looking at cute infantrymen sleeping in pajamas with open windows. She hates makeup and art schools don't wear pink dresses. She doesn't eat tuna. She loves kids, Beethoven and Badminton.
Get up, kids, get in the circle, get in the circle, get in the circle.

I'm gonna have kids around.
- The kids for half the price.
The kids are half-priced.
The kids are half-priced.
The kids are half-priced.
When I was a kid, I swore I'd be a priest.
When Jim and Julie were kids.
I remember once, on Independence Day, we invited all the neighbors with the kids.
She let the other kids ride.
She laughed so loudly at that wet guy that all the other kids, too, started jumping into the pond just to hear her laugh again. That's the same effect she laughed at you.
Ever since they were kids, I've had to take care of them, look after them, and all because of a disease that already lived inside them.
I was warned that under no circumstances should Jim and Julie marry and have children.
Oh, but the baby's great.
This, uh, kid has a father?
Venice... my baby, I was discharged from the hospital, exhausted, and without a penny of money in my stocking.
The baby and I haven't melted with him for a minute.
Your so-called white rags are baby diapers, my young friend.
Of course it's her baby.
We can't take a little baby with us.
And then, when you have kids,

What are you trying to do, drown my baby?
You had to use Gemma's baby to make a deal more than once.
Well, goodbye, kids.
But I have a baby.
Then you can take care of my baby.
If the baby's okay, I can keep it.
Yes, but my child is very sick.
The baby is very sick, and I was so scared.
Kids always have earaches or something.
The baby's sick, and I'm tired, and I don't count the shilling for the gas meter as a condition.
And the father has to go to work and the kids have to go to school, and then the kids come home and they play.
The baby died, and you and Fenella...
Because it's so easy for people to say they're sorry, but no one can say what it means for a mother to lose a child because she's the only one who understands who can imagine a person like that he'll grow up.
