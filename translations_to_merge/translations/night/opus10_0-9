- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I've been watching the door all night so I don't miss it if he comes out.

Two nights.
The way you moved, your speed, your reflexes... people can't suddenly learn to do that overnight.
We haven't talked to the other night, and...
The first night in the woods alone was pretty cool, actually.
